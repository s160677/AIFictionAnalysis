Title,Summary
Paradise Lost,"Milton's epic poem opens on the fiery lake of hell, where Satan and his army of fallen angels find themselves chained. Satan and his leutenant Beelzebub get up from the lake and yell to the others to rise and join them. Music plays and banners fly as the army of rebel angels comes to attention, tormented and defeated but faithful to their general. They create a great and terrible temple, perched on a volcano top, and Satan calls a council there to decide on their course of action. The fallen angels give various suggestions. Finally, Beelzebub suggests that they take the battle to a new battlefield, a place called earth where, it is rumoured, God has created a new being called man. Man is not as powerful as the angels, but he is God's chosen favorite among his creations. Beelzebub suggests that they seek revenge against God by seducing man to their corrupted side. Satan volunteers to explore this new place himself and find out more about man so that he may corrupt him. His fallen army unanimously agrees by banging on their swords. Satan takes off to the gates of hell, guarded by his daughter, Sin, and their horrible son, Death. Sin agrees to open the gates for her creator , knowing that she will follow him and reign with him in whatever kingdom he conquers. Satan then travels through chaos, and finally arrives at earth, connected to heaven by a golden chain. God witnesses all of this and points out Satan's journey to his Son. God tells his Son that, indeed, Satan will corrupt God's favorite creation, man. His Son offers to die a mortal death to bring man back into the grace and light of God. God agrees and tells how his Son will be born to a virgin. God then makes his Son the king of man, son of both man and God. Meanwhile, Satan disguises himself as a handsome cherub in order to get by the angel Uriel who is guarding earth. Uriel is impressed that an angel would come all the way from heaven to witness God's creation, and points the Garden of Eden out to Satan. Satan makes his way into the Garden and is in awe at the beauty of Eden and of the handsome couple of Adam and Eve. For a moment, he deeply regrets his fall from grace. This feeling soon turns, however, to hatred. Uriel, however, has realized that he has been fooled by Satan and tells the angel Gabriel as much. Gabriel finds Satan in the Garden and sends him away. God, seeing how things are going, sends Raphael to warn Adam and Eve about Satan. Raphael goes down to the Garden and is invited for dinner by Adam and Eve. While there, he narrates how Satan came to fall and the subsequent battle that was held in heaven. Satan first sin was pride, when he took issue with the fact that he had to bow down to the Son. Satan was one of the top angels in heaven and did not understand why he should bow. Satan called a council and convinced many of the angels who were beneath him to join in fighting God. A tremendous, cosmic three-day battle ensued between Satan's forces and God's forces. On the first day, Satan's forces were beaten back by the army led by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. On the second day, Satan seemed to gain ground by constructing artillery, literally cannons, and turning them against the good forces. On the third day, however, the Son faced Satan's army alone and they quickly retreat, falling through a hole in heaven's fabric and cascading down to hell. This is the reason, Raphael explains, that God created man: to replace the empty space that the fallen angels have left in heaven. Raphael then tells of how God created man and all the universe in seven days. Adam himself remembers the moment he was created and, as well, how he came to ask God for a companion, Eve. Raphael leaves. The next morning, Eve insists on working separately from Adam. Satan, in the form of serpent, finds her working alone and starts to flatter her. Eve asks where he learned to speak, and Satan shows her the Tree of Knowledge. Although Eve knows that this was the one tree God had forbidden that they eat from, she is told by Satan that this is only because God knows she will become a goddess herself. Eve eats the fruit and then decides to share it with Adam. Adam, clearly, is upset that Eve disobeyed God, but he cannot imagine a life without her so he eats the apple as well. They both, then, satiate their new-born lust in the bushes and wake up ashamed, knowing now the difference from good and evil . They spend the afternoon blaming each other for their fall. God sends the Son down to judge the two disobediant creatures. The Son condemns Eve, and all of womankind, to painful childbirths and submission to her husband. He condemns Adam to a life of a painful battle with nature and hard work at getting food from the ground. He condemns the serpent to always crawl on the ground on its belly, always at the heel of Eve's sons. Satan, in the meantime, returns to hell victorious. On the way, he meets Sin and Death, who have built a bridge from hell to earth, to mankind, whom they will now reign over. When Satan arrives in hell, however, he finds his fallen compatriots not cheering as he had wished, but hissing. The reason behind the horrible hissing soon becomes clear: all of the fallen angels are being transformed into ugly monsters and terrible reptiles. Even Satan finds himself turning into a horrible snake. Adam and Eve, after bitterly blaming each other, finally decide to turn to God and ask for forgiveness. God hears them and agrees with his Son that he will not lose mankind completely to Sin, Death and Satan. Instead, he will send his son as a man to earth to sacrifice himself and, in so doing, conquer the evil trinity. Michael is sent by God to escort Adam and Eve out of the Garden. Before he does, however, he tells Adam what will become of mankind unitl the Son comes down to earth. The history of mankind will be a series of falls from grace and acceptance back by God, from Noah and the Flood to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people. Adam is thankful that the Son will come down and right what he and Eve have done wrong. He holds Eve's hand as they are escorted out of the Garden."
The Federalist Papers,"The Federalist Papers is a treatise on free government in peace and security. It is an outstanding American contribution to the literature on constitutional democracy and federalism, and it is widely considered to be a classic of Western political thought. It is, by far, the most authoritative text concerning the interpretation of the American Constitution and an insight into the framers' intent.Although Hamilton carefully outlined the contents of The Federalist Papers at the end of the first essay, in reality, he strayed a bit from his original proposition. In the end, the work of (primarily) Madison and Hamilton can be divided into two main parts. The first discusses the defects of the present government, the Articles of Confederation. The second discusses the new Constitution's components: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Federalist Papers was written in order to secure the ratification of a constitution providing for a more perfect union. Throughout the papers, the idea of that more perfect union occupies center stage. At first glance, this might appear to be the primary purpose of the papers, but The Federalist Papers are concerned with much more than that. ""Union"" and the ""safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed"" are depicted as inseparable, and the Union appears as a means to achieve the safety and welfare of its parts. In general, then, The Federalist Papers discusses federalism as a means to achieve free government in peace and security. The Federalist Papers deals with not only the practical but also the theoretical, something that distinguishes this from other works. In a letter to his nephew, Thomas Mann Randolph, Thomas Jefferson distinguished The Federalist Papers from the theoretical writings of Locke when he wrote, after discussing Locke's philosophy: ""Descending from theory to practice, there can be no better book than The Federalist."" The authors, however, never considered their work to be a mere treatise on governmental practice. In their essays, they often draw a distinction between theory and practice: ""Theoretical reasoning must be qualified by the lessons of practice,"" Madison writes, and he also states that the Philadelphia Convention ""must have been compelled to sacrifice theoretical prosperity to the force of extraneous consideration."" Five basic themes can be discerned from the words of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay: federalism, checks and balances, separated powers, pluralism, and representation. Although the papers deal with different parts of the government, as noted above, these themes are fairly consistent throughout the collection. Much has been written concerning the sometimes dissonant nature of The Federalist Papers because they were written by multiple authors in a short amount of time. It is true that Madison later became the great states' rights defender while Hamilton was his principal opponent, but for the most part, these essays are collectively coherent, showing all sides of the proposed Constitution."
Adam Bede,"Adam Bede follows four characters in the rural village of Hayslope in 1799. It opens with the Bede brothers, Adam and Seth, at work in a carpentry shop. The other men tease Seth about his Methodism and the fact that he is in love with Dinah, the Methodist preacher. Dinah preaches in Hayslope that night and captivates even her skeptical audience. Seth walks her home and asks her to marry him for the second time, but she refuses, saying that it will interfere with her preaching. Adam returns home to his mother, who is worried that his father is not yet home because he has promised to make a coffin for the next day. Thias Bede used to be an honorable man who taught his sons carpentry, but he has become a drunk in the last few years. Angry with his father, Adam stays up the whole night to complete the work on the coffin. He hears a strange rapping on the door, but nobody is there. Captain Arthur Donnithorne visits his mentor, the vicar, and tells him about Dinah's preaching. They travel together to visit the Poyser farm so that the vicar can meet Dinah. At the Poysers' farm, Mrs. Poyser's niece, Dinah, and Mr. Poyser's niece are living with their aunt and uncle. Captain Arthur Donnithorne, whose aristocratic grandfather is the Poysers' landlord, asks to see Mrs. Poyser's dairy, while Dinah impresses the vicar by explaining to him why she feels called to preach. In the dairy, Arthur flirts with Hetty and ascertains that she walks alone to his estate to learn lace-making from his housekeeper. In the morning, Adam sets out to the village pub to find his father, but he finds him face-down, drowned in a stream. The news of the Bedes' misfortune spreads fast around the village, and Dinah visits Lisbeth Bede to comfort her. Despite the fact that she does not usually like Methodists--or any young women who she suspects could take her place in her sons' affections--Lisbeth takes to Dinah. She stays overnight with the Bedes to help Lisbeth. Arthur intercepts Hetty in the woods on her way to his estate. He flirts with her and kisses her. After she goes home, he decides that it is not a good idea to lead her on, and he resolves not to see her in the future. That night, Hetty dreams of marrying Arthur, becoming a gentlewoman, and owning beautiful women. Dinah surprises and frightens her by knocking on her door and saying that if she is ever in trouble, she should come to Dinah. There is a well-attended burial service in the parish for Thias Bede. Adam visits the Poysers afterward to continue his well-established courtship of Hetty. Hetty's uncle and aunt both approve highly of the match, but Adam is frustrated because he cannot tell whether Hetty loves him or not. After this visit, he attends night-school, where he is learning mathematics to improve his skill at carpentry. Bartle Massey, the schoolmaster, tells him that he would be better off to stay a bachelor. Arthur's and Hetty's secret affair continues, and he gives her a pair of beautiful earrings and a locket. At a celebration for Arthur's twenty-first birthday, he announces that he has appointed Adam Bede the steward for his estate's forest. This appointment will finally make Adam financially viable enough to ask Hetty to marry him. Walking through the woods a few days later, Adam is reflecting on how happy he is until he sees Arthur and Hetty kissing. Hetty runs away, and Adam confronts Arthur. The two get in a fistfight, and Adam knocks Arthur down. He makes Arthur promise to write a letter to Hetty that will end the affair. Adam personally delivers this letter to Hetty, who is devastated. The letter says, however, to call on Arthur if she is in any real trouble. Hetty tries to think of how she can get out of her situation and decides that her best move would be to marry Adam. Adam thinks that she has learned from her mistakes. They get engaged. As the marriage approaches, Hetty grows more and more worried. She gladly accepts as a pretext to run away her uncle's idea that she should leave to fetch Dinah from where she is preaching in Snowden. She takes all of her money and follows Arthur to Windsor where he has been stationed as a soldier. It takes all of her money to arrive there, and when she is informed that Arthur's troops have been sent to Ireland, she faints away. She remembers her cousin's invitation to look to her if she is ever in trouble. Hetty sets off in the opposite direction with the resolution that if she is too cowardly to commit suicide, she will find Dinah. Hetty's family becomes worried when she does not return after a number of days, and Adam Bede sets out in search of her. When he arrives in Hayslope, he finds that she has never visited to collect Dinah at all. Alarmed, he traces her to Stoniton. When he returns back to Hayslope, the vicar informs him that she has just been arrested for the murder of her own child. Adam is convinced that she is innocent until he attends her trial and sees the incontrovertible proof against her. One of the witnesses is a woman in whose house she delivered the baby. Another is a workingman who saw her near the spot where she partially buried the baby in a field before it died of exposure. Hetty is sentenced to execution. Dinah visits her in prison, persuades her to confess for the first time, and gives her spiritual counseling. Adam has sent for Arthur, who receives word first that his grandfather has died, so Arthur returns to Hayslope without knowing what has happened to Hetty. When he hears the news, he rushes to get a special pardon for her. It is delivered in the nick of time. He rides up to where Hetty is riding in the death cart accompanied by Dinah with the pardon. Hetty is re-sentenced to exile rather than death. Adam and Arthur meet again and agree to end their old argument. Arthur says that he is joining the military, and the two shake hands. Years later, Adam visits the Poysers as they try to convince Dinah not to leave on her preaching circuit yet again. She insists that she must go because of personal temptations. When Adam says that whatever she chooses will be right, she begins to cry. He brings her home to his mother, who is ill and wanted to see Dinah again. Dinah blushes every time that Adam talks to her, and Seth and Lisbeth see that she is in love with him. Lisbeth informs her son, who, after asking his brother's permission, asks her to marry him. She refuses, saying that her first priority is religion. She leaves for Leeds to preach. After she has been gone for a few days, Adam follows her to where she is preaching. He meets her on a hill, and she admits that she has been listening to her heart and what God is trying to tell her--and that it is to marry him. The two marry, and the epilogue depicts them living happily with their entire family, including two children."
Northanger Abbey,"As Austen's novel opens, we are introduced to Catherine Moreland, a seventeen-year old girl who is invited to go on a trip to Bath with her wealthy neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Allen. Catherine has never been away from home for an extended period of time, and she is excited to see the famed resort town. At Bath, Catherine is inducted into the social world of balls and entertainments. During one of their first nights in town, Catherine attends a ball in a venue called the Lower Rooms and meets a wealthy young clergyman named Henry Tilney. Henry charms Catherine with his gentle witticisms, and she is delighted to dance with him. Catherine seeks him out the next day at another social gathering, but Henry is nowhere to be found. Instead, Catherine is introduced to Mrs. Allen's friend Mrs. Thorpe, who has three daughters near Catherine's age. The eldest of these daughters, Isabella, befriends Catherine. It turns out that their brothers, James and John, are friends from Oxford. When James and John come to Bath for a visit, Isabella reveals her fondness for James, and John attempts to court Catherine by offering her carriage rides in the countryside. During the course of their first carriage ride, Catherine notes that John spends a great deal of his time bragging, but nonetheless she agrees to dance with him when he asks her to be his dance partner. At the ball that night, Henry returns, and Catherine wishes she could dance with him instead. It turns out that Henry left Bath for a week, but now that he is back Catherine finds herself increasingly enamored of him. John's presence becomes obtrusive and even odious to her. Meanwhile, Isabella and James have dove headlong into an open courtship, and Catherine finds that the two people she loves best in Bath--her brother and her closest friend--are devoting more and more time to each other, at the exclusion of her company. Catherine decides to become friends with Henry's sister Miss Tilney in order to fill the sudden lack of companionship. Of course, she also wants to know more about Henry. Catherine schedules a walk in the countryside with Miss Tilney and Henry, but on the morning of their walk it is raining, and the Tilneys do not arrive exactly on time. Isabella, James, and John persuade Catherine not to wait for them any longer, and Catherine agrees to go on a carriage ride instead. As soon as they set out, Catherine sees the Tilneys walking down the street. She is angry because John lied to her about their whereabounts: he'd told her that he had seen them leave town in a carriage earlier that day. Catherine wants to leave the carriage, but John only urges the horses to go faster. The walk is rescheduled for another day, and Catherine hopes that her friendship with the Tilneys can continue to progress. Once again, Isabella, James and John implore her to go on another carriage ride, and this time John sneaks away and tells the Tilneys that Catherine has to reschedule yet again. Catherine is visibly angry by this dishonest gesture, and she rushes over to the Tilneys' house to make amends. They accept her explanation, and the long-awaited walk is very pleasant. Meanwhile, James and Isabella become engaged during the course of their carriage ride. Catherine is happy at the pending union. James rushes off to get his parents' approval. He is successful, but he also reveals that his father can only provide them with a modest income. Isabella's expectations of a wealthy, lavish lifestyle are dashed by this news, and her demeanor sours, though she attempts to hide it. To make matters worse for James, the dashing Captain Tilney, Henry's older brother, arrives in Bath and begins to woo Isabella. Caught between her friend and her brother, Catherine is relieved when the Tilneys invite her to escape from the hustle of Bath and visit their house in the country, Northanger Abbey. Fueled by her knowledge of Gothic novels, Catherine imagines that the historic home is host to a variety of family secrets, and her imagination is incited when she discovers that Mrs. Tilney died of a sudden illness in the house. Catherine visits Mrs. Tilney's bedroom and cannot find any evidence for wrongdoing, but nonetheless she deludes herself into thinking that General Tilney had a hand in his wife's death. Her Gothic reverie is interrupted by Henry, who corrects her mistake and tells her to stop imposing her own fictional interpretations on reality: his father would never do such a thing to his mother. Catherine repents, and life returns to normal for a brief time. Suddenly, Catherine receives a letter from James stating that his engagement with Isabella has been broken off. Even more shockingly, James says that Isabella is now engaged to Captain Tilney. This turns out not to be true, as Catherine discovers when Isabella sends her a letter revealing that Captain Tilney has jilted her and left town. By now, Catherine is disgusted by Isabella's dishonorable and untrustworthy character, and she chooses not to respond to the letter. After a month at Northanger Abbey, Catherine is mysteriously cast out of the house by General Tilney. She goes home in disgrace and has a hard time settling into her former routine. Most of all, she misses Henry and wishes that she could be in communication with him. Before too many days pass, however, Henry surprises Catherine with a visit. He asks for her hand in marriage and explains that his father acted so rudely because he was informed that Catherine was not as rich as he had supposed her to be. Catherine is glad that the mystery is cleared up, but they still have to obtain the General's permission to get married. They finally get his consent after Miss Tilney marries a landed aristocrat, raising the family's status in the country. In the aftermath of this convenient marriage, Henry and Catherine seal their own matrimonial bliss."
My Antonia,"My Antonia begins with a short fictional introduction told by a nameless narrator, who may or may not be the author herself. The narrator tells you about a friend of hers named Jim Burden, a lawyer for one of the transcontinental railroads. The narrator and Jim were friends when they were kids, and they both knew a rather remarkable Bohemian immigrant girl named Antonia. The narrator, who is a writer, tells Jim that she wants to write about Antonia, but feels that Jim, who knew the girl better, is more qualified to do it. So Jim writes a memoir about the girl and calls it ""My Antonia,"" and the remainder of the novel is this memoir itself.Jim is ten years old and has recently been orphaned, so he moves from Virginia to Nebraska to live with his grandparents on their farm. On the ride there, Jim is accompanied by a farmhand named Jake Marpole, and hears that an immigrant family from Bohemia is traveling to the same area. Soon after he arrives on his grandparents' farm, Jim meets the Shimerdas, a Bohemian immigrant family, who turn out to be his grandparents' new closest neighbors. The family consists of Mr. Shimerda, who is unhappy in America and homesick for Bohemia; Mrs. Shimerda, who made the family move to America; Ambrosch, the rather mean and selfish oldest son; Antonia, who is four years older than Jim; and several other children.Mr. Shimerda asks Jim to teach Antonia English, and the two children soon become close friends. Jim seems to hold great admiration for Antonia - he associates her with the vast beauty of the Nebraskan landscape and the determination and will power common to early immigrants in the American West. As the two of them grow up, the exact nature of his feelings for her are not clear, particularly when it comes to the romantic element.The Shimerda family suffers through a tough winter, as they don't have a lot of money or friends in the new country. Jim's grandparents help out as much as they can, but Mr. Shimerda ends up committing suicide out of despair and homesickness. Antonia takes over many of her father's responsibilities, helping out her brother Ambrosch in the fields. When Jim goes off to school in town, she can't come with him, as she has to stay at the farm and work to support her family. Jim and Antonia's friendship becomes more distant at this point; he's upset with her for working like a man out in the fields, and of course he simply doesn't see her around much after he starts school.By the time Jim is ready for high school, he and his grandparents move off the farm and into the nearby town of Black Hawk, Nebraska. Antonia's family remains on the farm, but Antonia ends up moving in with a family in town called the Harlings and working as a cook/helper around the house. She is part of a group of ""hired girls,"" immigrant girls who work and live in town to support their families back on the farm. This group also includes Lena Lingard and their friend Tiny Soderball. Jim spends a lot of time with these girls, though many people in town look down on them as ""beneath"" the town girls, socially speaking.Everyone is growing up, and that includes Antonia, who ends up being rather beautiful. She, Tiny, and Lena get a lot of attention from the boys, especially at the town's Saturday night dances. Jim, as we've come to expect by now, never admits having any feelings for Antonia. He does lust after Lena, though Antonia warns him to stay away from her. Finally, Jim goes off to college in Lincoln, Nebraska and leaves the small town of Black Hawk behind. During his second year, Lena shows up, having moved to Lincoln herself to work as a dressmaker. The two of them start dating, much to the ruin of Jim's GPA. But then his tutor, Gaston, gets Jim to move to Harvard with him, and he leaves Lena behind. When Jim finishes college, he returns to Black Hawk for the summer before law school. He finds that things have not gone well for Antonia while he was gone. She was engaged to be married to a man who used up her money, got her pregnant, and then ran off before the wedding. Now she is back living on her family's farm and has a child. But she is otherwise unchanged. Jim sees that she is still fiery and proud. He heads off to Law school, promising Antonia that he'll come back and visit again soon.But Jim is afraid to go visit Antonia again because he doesn't want to find her old and broken. When he finally gets the courage to go back, twenty years have passed, and he is a successful New York lawyer. He finds Antonia on a farm, married, with about a dozen children. She is, of course, older, but unbroken and with the same spirit. The two of them are happy to see each other and talk about how much they meant to each other when they were growing up. Jim even admits to Antonia's children that he used to be in love with their mother. As he's leaving the farm, Jim decides it was destiny that he and Antonia were brought together again after all those years apart, and concludes that together they still share ""the incommunicable past"" ."
A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,"Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a treatise on overcoming the ways in which women in her time are oppressed and denied their potential in society, with concomitant problems for their households and society as a whole. The dedication is to Charles M. Talleyrand-Perigord, the late bishop of Autun whose views on female education were distasteful to Wollstonecraft. The introduction sets out her view that neglect of girls' education is largely to blame for the condition of adult women. They are treated as subordinate beings who care only about being attractive, elegant, and meek, they buy into this oppression, and they do not have the tools to vindicate their fundamental rights or the awareness that they are in such a condition. In the first chapter Wollstonecraft promotes reason and rationality and discusses the deleterious effects of absolute, arbitrary political power and the vices associated with riches and hereditary honors. Chapters two and three detail the various ways in which women are rendered subordinate. They are taught that their looks are of paramount concern, and they tend to cultivate weakness and artificiality to appear pleasing to others. They are seldom independent and tend not to exercise reason. Writers like Rousseau and Dr. Gregory desire that women remain virtual slaves, enshrined in the home and concerned only with their ""natural"" proclivities of being modest, chaste, and beautiful. Women are taught to indulge their emotions and thus have unhappy marriages because passion cannot be sustained. Virtue should not be relative to gender; as both men and women were created by God and have souls, they have the same kind of propensity to exercise reason and develop virtue. Female dependence as seen in her day is not natural. Women's confinement in the home and inability to participate in the public sphere results in their insipidness and pettiness. Wollstonecraft wants to inspire a ""revolution in female manners."" In chapter four she excoriates the premise that pleasure is the ultimate goal of a woman's life. Reason and common sense are usually ignored in favor of emotion and sentiment, and young girls are taught every early to concern themselves only with their persons. Such trends are problematic for mothers, who either spoil their children or ignore them. In addition, marriage should resemble friendship because husband and wife should be companions. In chapter five Wollstonecraft lambastes many of the writers who have perpetuated these ideas. In chapter six she explains the importance of early associations for the development of character; for women, false notions and early impressions are not tempered by knowledge or nuance. Girls begin to prefer rakes to decent men. In chapters seven and eight Wollstonecraft addresses the subject of modesty and explains that modesty is not the same as humility. The women who exercise the most reason are the most modest. Women's modesty can only improve when their bodies are strengthened and their minds enlarged by active exertions. Women's morality is undermined, however, when reputation is upheld as the most significant thing they should keep intact. Men place the burden of upholding chastity on a woman's shoulders, yet men also must be chaste. In chapter nine Wollstonecraft calls for more financial independence for women, expresses the need for duty and activity in the public sphere, argues for the need to be a good citizen as well as a good mother, and describes the various pursuits women might take on in society. Chapters ten and eleven concern parenting duties, repeating that there must be reforms in education for women to be good mothers who neither tyrannize over their children nor spoil them. Chapter twelve concerns Wollstonecraft's ideas for education reform. These include a conflation of public and private education, co-education, and a more democratic, participatory educational structure. Chapter thirteen sums up her arguments. She details the various ways in which women indulge their silliness. These include visiting mediums, fortune tellers, and healers; reading stupid novels; engaging in rivalries with other women; immoderately caring about dress and manners; and indulging their children and treating them like idols. Women and men must have things in common to have successful marriages. Overall, women's faults do not result of a natural deficiency but stem from their low status in society and insufficient education."
Little Women,"Little Women chronicles approximately fifteen years in the life of the March family. It comes largely from the experiences of the family of the author Louisa May Alcott. The Marches live in Concord, Massachusetts, and the book begins at Christmas, 1861, during the Civil War. Part I of the book covers just over one year. The March family is relatively poor, though they can still afford one servant and they often share whatever they have with others less fortunate. Mr. March is a philosopher and teacher. He serves as a Chaplain in the Union Army until he gets ill. After being nursed to health by his wife, he returns to Concord and becomes a minister. A kind but unworldly man, he lost the family property trying to help a friend, which brought poverty upon the family for some time. He leads the family quietly, urging Christian morality and kindness. Mrs. March, or ""Marmee"" is a strong, kind, and moral character. She advocates a healthy balance of work and play and urges her daughters to marry good, kind men. She is patient with the family's poverty, reminding the girls to remember their many blessings. She is the rock of the family. When she leaves to help nurse her husband, she must later return to nurse her daughter Beth, and she comforts the girls through many challenges. In Part I, the girls decide to improve their characters while their Father is gone, so they can make him proud when he returns. They use the story Pilgrim's Progress to add fun and meaning to their goals. Meg, sixteen, wants to overcome vanity and complain less about poverty and hard work. She struggles with envying luxurious things, and occasionally tries them for herself, but always feels disingenuous and wrong. She chooses to marry the poor but good John Brooke, who tutored her neighbor Laurie. Meg and John are very happy together and have twins, Daisy and Demi. Jo, fifteen at the start, is based on the author and is often considered the main character. She is a tomboy and a writer with a fierce temper and a dislike for doing what society thinks is proper. Jo struggles throughout the book to become womanlier. She is completely devoted to her family and tries to earn money writing so she can help them. Jo is best friends with the March family's neighbor Laurie, who eventually proposes to her, but she loves him only as a brother. After nursing her sister Beth through illness and death, Jo becomes tenderer, and marries a German professor named Mr. Bhaer. They open a school for boys. Beth, thirteen at the start, is a quiet and selfless girl. She loves music and is given a piano by their neighbor Mr. Laurence. Beth struggles to overcome her bashfulness throughout Part I. She also contracts scarlet fever while helping a poor family. She comes very close to dying in Part I, and, forever weakened by the fever, dies in Part II. Amy, twelve, is the young spoiled pet of the family. She loves to draw and tries to use long words she does not understand in order to sound older and fancy. Similar to Meg, Amy has aristocratic tastes. She tries to be less selfish and become a true lady, generous and graceful. Amy is very much Jo's opposite, and Jo is heartbroken when an Aunt asks Amy to go abroad instead of tomboy Jo. Amy studies art abroad and considers marrying friend Fred Vaughn since he is rich, though she does not love him. Her conscience and their friend Laurie help her realize that would be a mistake. In Europe, Amy and Laurie fall in love and are married. Laurie, the neighbor, is Jo's age. He is raised by his grandfather, who always fears Laurie will run away to play music rather than stay to work in the family business. Laurie benefits greatly from the March family's influence, and they benefit from his generosity. In addition to being wealthy, Laurie is kind, lively, and good. He is devastated when Jo does not accept his marriage proposal. His grandfather takes him overseas, where he realizes he loves Jo like a brother, and he falls in love with Amy. From the interactions among these main characters, Alcott weaves a lively but domestic, and incredibly popular tale of American youth in the nineteenth century. Her characters focus on their moral development but they have weaknesses and humor to make them human and relatable. Alcott's deep depiction of the female characters was unique for its time and implicitly argued for women's equality in the home and outside of it. Through their experiences, the characters learn to appreciate the enduring importance of family, the happiness derived from being selfless and dutiful, the disconnection between wealth and happiness, and the benefits of working hard to improve oneself and one's home."
The House of Mirth,"Meet Miss Lily Bart. She's 29, beautiful, and poised to marry a rich, boring bachelor in New York in the late 1800s. Lily's main candidate is Percy Gryce, millionaire and bore-extraordinaire. While staying with a rich couple, Judy and Gus Trenor, Lily gets a chance to spend some time with Percy. But she is distracted by Lawrence Selden, a young lawyer who doesn't have a lot of money, but who is clearly Lily's intellectual and emotional soul mate.To make matters more complicated, Bertha and George Dorset - another wealthy couple - are also in the picture. Bertha once had an affair with Selden, and she's jealous of Lily for captivating his attention. When Lily flirts with Selden, Bertha tells Percy, who runs away.Lily is determined to get her rich potential-husband back, but before she can, he gets engaged to another woman. Lily, whose parents are both dead, lives with a wealthy aunt, but has no money. She needs cash to keep her going until she marries, so she asks Gus Trenor to speculate on the stock market for her. Gus agrees and the money starts flowing.Meanwhile, Lily wards off the attentions of a social climber named Simon Rosedale. Rosedale seemingly has more money than the rest of the world put together, and he's trying to use it to break into the social circles that Lily frequents. She's not interested and snubs him.And now for an interesting plot twist. A charwoman who once saw Lily with Lawrence Selden drops by to see her with a series of love letters she stole from Selden's garbage. She thinks the letters belong to Lily. Looking them over, Lily realizes they were written from Bertha Dorset to Selden. She now has proof of the alleged affair. Lily purchases the letters and puts them away for safe-keeping.One night, Lily gets an invitation to visit Judy Trenor at her home. She goes, only to find that Gus Trenor is there by himself and has now compromised Lily by getting her alone with him in the late hours of the night. Trenor explains that he's been straight-up giving Lily all the money she thought she had earned on the stock market, and now she owes him . Horrified and ashamed at her position, Lily flees the house.Meanwhile, Lawrence Selden has decided he's in love with Lily and wants to marry her. While he's working on the wording for his proposal, he sees Lily run out of Gus Trenor's house in the late hours of the night. He's super angry and high-tails it for Europe. The next day, Simon Rosedale proposes to Lily, and she turns him down. Soon after, Lily receives an invitation from Bertha Dorset to join her and her husband George on a cruise in the Mediterranean.So, Lily heads for Europe. It's clear to everyone that Bertha invited her along to keep her husband, George, distracted while she carries on an affair with a young man named Ned Silverton. Lily is caught in the crossfire when scandal arises; Bertha is out all night with Ned, alone. In order to deflect the attention from herself, Bertha accuses Lily of having an affair with George and publicly disgraces her. Selden, who shows up in the Mediterranean just in time, tries to help Lily, but to no avail.Lily heads back to America when her Aunt Julia dies. Lily is relieved to finally stop worrying about her finances, since her aunt had about $400,000 to her name. Unfortunately, Aunt Julia heard about the scandal in Europe and essentially wrote Lily out of the will .Distraught, Lily turns to two friends, Gerty Farish and divorcee Carry Fisher. Both women try to help her through the difficulties. Mrs. Fisher sets Lily up as a social networker, first for a woman just below the elite on the social ladder, and then for someone lower down when that doesn't work out .In the meantime, Lily has been trying to win back the affections of Simon Rosedale. Rosedale admits that he is in love with Lily, but he wants a wife who will root him firmly among society's elite, and Lily is no longer in a position to do so. He says that if she reconciles with Bertha Dorset, he will marry her. He suggests that she uses those blackmail letters she bought from the charwoman...Lily doesn't want to break up the Dorset marriage, despite several pleas from George Dorset to help him do so. Instead, she sinks further and further into poverty, finally taking a job as a milliner but getting fired for being incompetent. She starts taking a prescription drug called chloral to help her sleep at night. She waits desperately for her ten thousand dollar inheritance, but she knows that she wants to pay Gus Trenor back for the ""speculation"" he did for her, so that she can get out of his debt. On the brink of misery, Lily decides to take Rosedale up on his still-standing offer and blackmail Bertha Dorset with the letters. On the way to the Dorsets', though, she has a moral awakening and instead stops by Selden's place. She thanks him for always having faith in her as a good person, and burns Bertha's letters when he has his back turned.Lily returns home for the night to discover that her inheritance check has finally come. She writes out a check to Gus Trenor for the nine thousand she owes him, puts everything in order, and takes her chloral - more than the maximum allowed dosage - to help her sleep. Whether or not Lily intentionally commits suicide or accidentally overdoses is unclear.The next morning, Selden wakes up and decides that he's in love with Lily again. He rushes over to her apartment to propose, only to find that she's dead of an overdose. He goes through her personal things, finds the inheritance money and the check to Gus Trenor, and pieces together the whole story. He now loves the Lily more than ever."
The House of the Seven Gables,"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables is, as the author notes in a short preface to the novel, a romance. The story thus, as Hawthorne states, includes fantastical occurrences, improbabilities, and attempts to connect the past with the present, sacrificing literal authenticity for more abstract truths. The connection between the past and the present is the most pressing of Hawthorne's concerns in The House of the Seven Gables, which begins with the checkered history of the eponymous house. The house was constructed during the Puritan era in New England by the prominent Colonel Pyncheon. He acquired the property through dubious means: the property on which the house was built was originally owned by Matthew Maule, a relatively obscure man who was often called a wizard. Soon after Matthew Maule refused to sell the property to Colonel Pyncheon, he was charged with witchcraft and burned; Colonel Pyncheon led the charge against him, and thus acquired the property. Years later, Colonel Pyncheon himself died suspiciously, with a bloody hand-print on his throat. The Pyncheon family seemed poised to remain prominent, yet the family steadily declined throughout the subsequent generations. However, every generation or so another Pyncheon appeared who seemed to possess Colonel Pyncheon's characteristics and would instill hope that the Pyncheons would return to their former glory once more. Yet the most recent notable occurrence in the family history was the murder of a Pyncheon by his nephew years before. Having traced the family history, the story begins in its contemporary period in which Hepzibah Pyncheon, an elderly woman and the current resident of the House of the Seven Gables, opens a tiny penny store in the house. She has been forced to do so because of a decline in the family fortune that reduced her to poverty. Her most prominent feature is an angry scowl, caused not by any ill temper, but rather because of vision problems. Hepzibah has few customers in this little store. One little boy, Ned Higgins, buys tons of gingerbread from her. Another customer, the young daguerreotypist Mr. Holgrave, is a boarder in the House of the Seven Gables and Hepzibah's only friend. When she sees her cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, she retreats back into the house. Jaffrey is the current embodiment of Colonel Pyncheon's spirit among the Pyncheons. She blames Jaffrey for the imprisonment of Clifford, the Pyncheon mentioned earlier who was convicted of murder and whose return from prison after many years is imminent. That night, Phoebe Pyncheon, a seventeen year old relative, arrives from the country, wishing to stay at the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe immediately brightens the dreary and decrepit house, and even helps Hepzibah establish her store. Holgrave tells Phoebe the history of the Pyncheon family, in particular the controversy surrounding the supposedly murderous Clifford. Clifford soon returns to the House of the Seven Gables after decades in prison. Now an old man, he is frail and weakly. A natural lover of beauty, he responds most strongly to the young and pretty Phoebe. Although he wishes to leave the house for Europe, Hepzibah admits to Clifford that they are now impoverished and she has been forced to open a shop. The next day at the store, Judge Jaffrey meets Phoebe and insists that he see Clifford. He also attempts to kiss Phoebe, an action that she sternly refuses. Hepzibah refuses to allow Jaffrey access to Clifford, despite the Judge's offer to take Clifford off her hands. Yet after this episode things return to some sense of order. Clifford begins to rely on Phoebe for his sustenance. She dotes on him, for he needed so much love and had received so little. Clifford, Phoebe and Hepzibah essentially enclose themselves within the House of the Seven Gables. Their only visitors are Holgrave, who constantly observes the family as if he were collecting information, and Uncle Venner, a local elderly man largely considered mentally deficient. Clifford spends most of his time watching the outside world from the arched window of the house. When an organ-grinder stops and plays for him, Clifford suddenly goes into hysterics and nearly jumps off of the balcony. Holgrave soon reveals the history of the Pyncheon family to Phoebe. He tells her that he has been collecting information in order to a publish a story on the Pyncheon family history, and details to her the story of Alice Pyncheon. Several generations before, Gervayse Pyncheon, the grandson of Colonel Pyncheon, summoned the grandson of Matthew Maule to the House of the Seven Gables. He wanted to find a hidden map and deed to land in the eastern part of Maine. Gervayse accused Matthew Maule's father of hiding the deed as revenge for his grandfather's fate, but Matthew Maule replied that he would help Gervayse Pyncheon only if he gave up the land that rightfully belongs to the Maules. Matthew Maule then asked to see Gervayse's daughter, Alice. Matthew Maule cast some sort of spell on her that rendered her under his control. While in a trance, Alice Pyncheon claimed that she knew the secret to the eastern land. Alice Pyncheon died from illness some time later when Matthew Maule ordered her to serve his fiancee and caused her to walk home in the rain. When Holgrave finishes his story, Phoebe is shocked, appearing to be in a trance similar to that which afflicted Alice Pyncheon, but Holgrave soon snaps her out of it. She soon departs from the House of the Seven Gables for her home in the country. Without Phoebe, Clifford becomes extremely depressed. Judge Pyncheon visits once more and demands to see Clifford. He threatens Hepzibah with having Clifford institutionalized for his irrational behavior, such as his outburst at the arched window. Hepzibah accuses Judge Pyncheon of committing the same crime as Colonel Pyncheon, but goes to find her brother. When she cannot find him, she returns to the room where the Judge was sitting to find Clifford next to him, and the Judge dead from a stroke. Thinking that he will be blamed for Judge Pyncheons' death, Clifford and Hepzibah immediately leave town on a train, yet have no concrete destination. Clifford is energized by his escape from the House of the Seven Gables, and eagerly chats with others on the train. However, his conversations with the passengers are fanciful and often indicate his tenuous grip on reality. He even muses on the actual state of a supposed criminal, hypothetically describing a situation such as the one he now faces. Clifford and Hepzibah leave the train at a desolate town. Back at the House of the Seven Gables, the townspeople realize that something is wrong when Hepzibah does not open her little shop that day. Phoebe returns to the house to find Holgrave, who tells her what has happened. The stroke that killed Judge Pyncheon was the same affliction that killed his uncle years before. Judge Pyncheon framed Clifford for this natural death in order to receive his cousin's inheritance. According to Holgrave, Pyncheon men have a tendency to die in this manner: likewise, Colonel Pyncheon's death can be attributed to this brain failure. Holgrave declares his love for Phoebe, claiming that she brought the first stirrings of life to the House of the Seven Gables in years. Clifford and Hepzibah return to the house, drained by their panicked flight. Clifford is not blamed for Judge Pyncheon's death; rather, since the Judge's son had died in Europe, he was named the heir to the Judge's fortune. Holgrave, who reveals himself to be a descendant of Matthew Maule, reveals the location of the map and deed to the eastern lands, which were hidden behind the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon. After receiving their inheritance, Phoebe, Clifford and Hepzibah move into Judge Pyncheon's mansion, leaving Holgrave in the property rightly belonging to his ancestors. When they leave the House of the Seven Gables, people remark how it appears that Hepzibah became rich from her little penny store."
A Study in Scarlet,"A Study in Scarlet begins with Dr. John Watson, the narrator, settling in London to recover from a wound and illness he sustained while acting as a military doctor during the Second Afghan War. One day he runs into an acquaintance, Stamford, while at a bar. Watson confides in his friend that he needs a new living arrangement, as his previous one was too expensive. Stamford responds that another friend of his has also expressed this desire, and takes Watson to the university laboratory where his friend -Sherlock Holmes -is working on an experiment. Stamford gives some background information on Holmes, such as the fact that his true profession is unknown, that he is eccentric and brilliant, and that his knowledge is specialized but diverse. After discussing their personal idiosyncrasies, Holmes and Watson decide to live together. Watson watches the enigmatic Holmes and notes his strange behavior and interests. The living arrangement proves itself pleasant for both men. One morning Watson notices an article about the art of deduction based on observation. The tiniest detail can yield a multiplicity of information. Watson scoffs at this theory, but is surprised to learn that Holmes was the article's author. Holmes explains that he is a consulting detective; his powers of rational, reasoned observation and deduction allow him to help clients and even solve crimes. He laments that there have been very few good cases of late. However, a good case soon drops in his lap when he is asked by Scotland Yard detective Gregson to assist him in solving a crime just recently committed. Holmes asks Watson to accompany him and they travel to an empty house in a London neighborhood. There they observe a crime scene that includes cab prints in the street and footprints in the yard, a dead man who has been poisoned but not robbed laid out in a room, and the word RACHE in blood on the wall. A woman's wedding ring falls off of the body when it is lifted. The dead man's name is Enoch Drebber, and he was from Cleveland. There was a note to his secretary, Joseph Stangerson. Over the next couple of days Watson watched more pieces of the puzzle fall into place for Holmes. He informed Watson how he determined the murderer's age and height from his observations, as well as his complexion. An interview with the constable on duty that night revealed that a drunken man in the street was actually probably the murderer returned for the ring. In the middle of the investigation, another Scotland Yard detective on the case named Lestrade, whom Holmes respected, bursts into the Holmes' and Watson's apartment announcing that Stangerson had also been killed. This turned out to be a result of a stabbing, not poison. In Stangerson's room was a box of the pills that Holmes identified as the method of death for Drebber. With this piece of information Holmes excitedly announces that his investigation is complete. Moments later, a cab driver that Holmes called for arrived to pick him up. Holmes burst out that this man, Jefferson Hope, is the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson. With the help of Watson and the detectives, the man was subdued. This is the end of part one. Part two begins with a vivid description of the wild, isolated, and dangerous great American desert. There were two travelers struggling to survive after the deaths of their companions -the tall and gaunt John Ferrier, and his tiny and lovely adopted daughter Lucy. They were rescued from starvation by a massive caravan -the Latter Day Saints on their exodus. Their leader Brigham Young allowed Ferrier to travel with them if he converts; the latter agreed. The caravan continued to Utah. The subsequent years saw the population and wealth of the Mormons' chosen site of Salt Lake City explode. Ferrier grew prosperous amongst the Mormons, but refused to marry. Lucy grew up beautiful and independent. One day she was saved from near death in a herd of stampeding cattle by the handsome, solitary, and industrious hunter/miner Jefferson Hope. The two fell in love and Ferrier gave them his permission to marry when Hope returned from a few months' journey. This was unacceptable to Brigham Young, who personally visited Ferrier and commanded Lucy to marry one of the sons of the Elders, Enoch Drebber or Joseph Stangerson. He gave Ferrier a month for her to decide. Young's behavior was typical of the manner in which the Mormons had been conducting themselves; they were once persecuted but had now turned persecutors. Their community was secretive, violent, controlling, and exclusive. Ferrier had long hated the Mormons and promised his daughter she would not have to marry either of the sons and that they could escape. Drebber and Stangerson arrogantly visited Ferrier's house to talk to him about Lucy, but he threw them out. This egregious act of disrespect increased the surveillance and threats levied upon Ferrier and his daughter. Finally, the night before the month was up, Jefferson Hope arrived at their home in the middle of the night and the three escaped into the mountains. Unfortunately, when Hope went off to hunt game to feed to famished escapees, he returned to an empty campsite -Ferrier had been murdered and Lucy abducted for marriage. Hope made his way back down to Salt Lake City and learned that Lucy had been married to Drebber a few days before. Within a month she died from heartsickness. Hope swore that he would spend his life exacting revenge for the murders . Taking her wedding ring off her dead finger before she was buried, Hope fled Utah to concoct a plan and raise money. He tracked Drebber and Stangerson all over Europe. The two men had been part of a fringe group of Mormons that had broken away. They were also aware that Hope had been dogging their steps for many years, and always managed to be a step ahead of him. Hope finally learned they were in London and set in motion his plan to murder them. At this point the narrative returns to Holmes, Watson, the detectives, and their detainee. Hope was taken to the police station but asks to tell his tale because he would not be going to be able to have a trial or go to prison. The men learned this was because Hope had an aortic aneurism that could burst any day. He was allowed to finish his narrative. Hope explained how he got a job as a cab driver and tracked Drebber and Stangerson. He caught Drebber drunk one night and killed him with poison. He tried to do the same with Stangerson but had to stab him in self-defense when the latter fought back. He remained driving the cab for a few days so as to not appear suspicious. The next day Hope was discovered dead of the aneurism, a peaceful smile upon his face. Holmes spoke with Watson about his ability to reason backwards; this method helped him solve the case. He further elucidated the ways in which he figured out certain aspects of the case, especially that it was about a woman. The novel ends with Holmes and Watson reading a newspaper article about the end of the investigation; it only mentions Holmes as an amateur detective who helped but gave primary credit to Lestrade and Gregson."
The Life of Timon of Athens,"Read the full text of The Life of Timon of Athens with a side-by-side translation HERE. Timon has it all. He's rich and powerful, and he's got a stellar set of friends. He's living the high life up in Athens. When some merchants show up at his house selling paintings, jewels, and fancy poetry, he's happy to pay them handsomely. When his friend owes a debt, he pays it. When his servant wants to get married, he foots the bill. You get the idea. But Timon doesn't stop there. He throws extravagant parties, night after night. He gives his friends expensive gifts. His steward Flavius is a little concerned about how much money Timon is spending all the time, but every time he tries to talk to Timon about it, Timon brushes him off. One day, a Senator asks Timon to repay his debt. Timon has borrowed a couple thousand from him, and he wants it back. There's just one tiny problem: Timon doesn't have the money to repay the Senator--and that's a surprise to him. He asks his steward to repay the man, but he's shocked when his steward says he can't. There's no money left. Timon isn't too worried, because he's got an amazing set of friends, after all. When he sends his servants to ask them for a little dough, though, he's totally denied. Each one of his friends was eager to eat at his house and take his gifts, but when he asks for something from them, they don't give him the time of day. Disgruntled, confused, and betrayed, Timon hosts one more dinner party, during which he sticks it to his so-called friends. He throws water and stones at them, cursing their very existence. Timon has no money and no place to live, so he runs away to the woods. There, he becomes bitter and angry at all of mankind. He also finds a pot of gold in the ground. He decides that money is the root of all evil: it turns men into greedy beasts. That doesn't stop him from using it to get what he wants, though. Timon comes across his old acquaintance Alcibiades, who has been banished from Athens for disagreeing with the Senators about the death penalty. Timon helps Alcibiades by giving him gold so that he can destroy the city of Athens. Then Timon does the only thing he has left to do: write his own epitaph. He's so livid and cynical at everyone that even when Flavius, his own steward, shows up to help him, he doesn't want it. Meanwhile, Alcibiades overtakes Athens and forces Timon's enemies to surrender. A soldier finds a tomb in the woods with an inscription about how Timon hates mankind and curses everyone. Alcibiades promises that Timon will never be forgotten."
Hamlet,"Something is amiss in Denmark -- for two successive nights, the midnight guard has witnessed the appearance of the ghost of Old Hamlet, the former King of Denmark who has recently died. The guards bring Horatio, a learned scholar and friend of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, to witness this apparition. Though skeptical at first, Horatio sees the ghost and decides to report its appearance to Hamlet. Meanwhile, a new king of Denmark has been crowned: Claudius, Old Hamlet's brother. Claudius has taken Old Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, as his wife. We watch their marriage celebration and hear about a threat from the Prince of Norway, Fortinbras, which Claudius manages to avoid by diplomacy. Hamlet is in attendance at this wedding celebration; he is hardly in joyous spirits, however. He is disgusted by his mother's decision to marry Claudius so soon after his father's demise. Horatio tells Hamlet of the appearance of the ghost and Hamlet determines to visit the spirit himself. Meanwhile, the court adviser, Polonius, sends his son, Laertes, back to Paris, where he is living. Laertes and Polonius both question Ophelia about her relationship with Hamlet. Ophelia admits that Hamlet has been wooing her. They tell her to avoid Hamlet and reject his amorous advances, emphasizing the importance of protecting her chastity. Ophelia agrees to cut off contact. That night, Hamlet accompanies the watch. The ghost appears once more. Hamlet questions the ghost, who beckons Hamlet away from the others. When they are alone, the ghost reveals that Claudius murdered him in order to steal his crown and his wife. The ghost makes Hamlet promise to take revenge on Claudius. Hamlet appears to concur excitedly. He has Horatio and the guards swear not to reveal what they have seen. Act Two finds us some indefinite time in the future. Hamlet has been behaving in a most erratic and alarming way. Claudius summons two of Hamlet's school friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, in order to discover the meaning of this strange behavior. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's attempts to discover the reason for Hamlet's madness are met with evasion and witticism. Meanwhile, Polonius hatches a theory of his own: he thinks that Hamlet is insane due to Ophelia's rejection of his love. He arranges to test his theory by setting Ophelia on Hamlet when they are apparently alone and then observing the proceedings with Claudius. Hamlet's only consolation appears to be the coming of a troupe of players from England. Hamlet asks the player's whether they could play a slightly modified version of a tragedy. We realize that Hamlet plans to put on a play that depicts the death of his father, to see whether Claudius is really guilty, and the ghost is really to be trusted. In Act Three, Ophelia approaches Hamlet when they are apparently alone; Claudius and Polonius hide behind a tapestry and observe. Hamlet behaves extremely cruelly toward Ophelia. The king decides that Hamlet is not mad for love of her but for some other hidden reason. Hamlet prepares to put on his play, which he calls ""The Mouse Trap."" After instructing the players in their parts, Hamlet retires to the audience, where Claudius, Gertrude, Ophelia, and Polonius have gathered, along with many others. In the course of the play, both Gertrude and Claudius become extremely upset, though for different reasons. Gertrude is flustered by Hamlet's veiled accusation that she was inconstant and hypocritical for remarrying after Old Hamlet's death; Claudius is shaken because he is indeed guilty of his brother's murder. Claudius decides that he must get rid of Hamlet by sending him to England. Following the play, Gertrude calls Hamlet to her room, intending to berate him for his horrible insinuations. Hamlet turns the tables on her, accusing her of a most grotesque lust and claiming that she has insulted her father and herself by stooping to marry Claudius. In the course of their interview, Polonius hides behind a tapestry; at one point, he thinks that Hamlet is going to attack Gertrude and cries for help. Hamlet stabs Polonius through the tapestry, thinking he has killed Claudius. When he finds that he has merely killed a ""rash, intruding fool,"" Hamlet returns to the business of ""speaking daggers"" to his mother. Just as Gertrude appears convinced by Hamlet's excoriation, the ghost of Old Hamlet reappears and tells Hamlet not to behave so cruelly to his mother, and to remember to carry out revenge on Claudius. Gertrude perceives her son discoursing with nothing but air and is completely convinced of his madness. Hamlet exits her room, dragging the body of Polonius behind him. After much questioning, Claudius convinces Hamlet to reveal the hiding place of Polonius' body. He then makes arrangements for Hamlet to go to England immediately, accompanied by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Claudius writes a letter to the English court asking them to kill Hamlet immediately upon his arrival and places the letter with his two cronies. On their way to the ship, Hamlet and his entourage pass Fortinbras' Norwegian army en route to a Polish campaign. Back at Elsinore , Ophelia has gone mad following her father's death. She sings childish and bawdy songs and speaks nonsensically. Laertes soon returns to Denmark with a mob in tow, demanding an explanation of Polonius' death. Claudius gingerly calms the young man and convinces him that Hamlet was the guilty party. Letters arrive attesting to a strange turn of fortunes on the sea. Hamlet's ship to England was attacked by pirates, who captured Hamlet and arranged to return him to Denmark for a ransom. Hamlet sends Claudius an aggravating letter announcing his imminent return. Claudius and Laertes decide that Hamlet must be killed. They decide to arrange a duel between Laertes and Hamlet in which Laertes' sword is secretly poisoned so as to guarantee Hamlet's immediate death. As backup, Claudius decides to poison a cup of wine and offer it to Hamlet during the contest. Just as Act Four comes to a close, more tragic news arrives. Gertrude says that Ophelia has drowned while playing in a willow tree by the river. Act Five begins at a graveyard. Two gravediggers joke about their morbid occupation. Hamlet and Horatio arrive and converse with them. Soon, Ophelia's funeral begins. Because there are doubts about whether Ophelia died accidentally or committed suicide, her funeral lacks many of the customary religious rites. Laertes bombastically dramatizes his grief, prompting Hamlet to reveal himself and declare his equal grief at the loss of his erstwhile beloved. After a short tussle, Hamlet and Laertes part. Later, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he discovered Claudius' plot to have him killed in England and forged a new letter arranging for the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. While they are conversing, Osric, a ridiculous courtier, approaches and proposes the duel between Laertes and Hamlet. Hamlet eventually accepts this challenge. The duel begins with Osric as referee. Hamlet wins the first two passes, prompting Claudius to resort to the poisoned drink. Hamlet refuses the drink. In his stead, Gertrude drinks a toast to her son from the poisoned cup. After a third pass also goes to Hamlet, Laertes sneak-attacks the prince and wounds him. A scuffle ensues in which Hamlet ends up with Laertes' sword. He injures Laertes. Just then Gertrude collapses. She declares that she has been poisoned. Laertes, also dying, confesses the whole plot to Hamlet, who finally attacks Claudius, stabbing him with the poisoned sword and then forcing the poisoned drink down his throat. Hamlet too is dying. He asks Horatio to explain the carnage to all onlookers and tell his story. Hamlet dies. Just then, Fortinbras arrives at the court, accompanying some English ambassadors who bring word of the death of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. With all the immediate royalty of Denmark dead, Fortinbras asserts his right to the crown. He arranges for Hamlet to receive a soldier's burial."
Othello,"Othello begins in the city of Venice, at night. Iago, an ensign in the Venetian army, is bitter about being passed over for lieutenant in favor of Cassio. Iago tells Roderigo that he serves Othello, the Moor who is the army's general, only in order to serve himself. Iago knows that Desdemona, the daughter of nobleman Brabantio, has run off to marry Othello. He also knows that Roderigo lusts after Desdemona, so Iago manipulates him into alerting Venice. Iago's duplicity arises even in the first scene. Learning of his daughter's elopement, Brabantio panics, and calls for people to try and find Desdemona. Iago joins Othello, and tells him about Roderigo's betrayal of the news of his marriage to Brabantio. Cassio comes at last, as do Roderigo and Brabantio; Brabantio is very angry, swearing to the men assembled that Othello must have bewitched his daughter. Brabantio's grievance is denied, and Desdemona will indeed stay with Othello. However, Othello is called away to Cyprus, to defend it from an invasion of Turks. Iago assures an upset Roderigo that the match between Othello and Desdemona will not last long, and at any time, Desdemona could come rushing to him. Iago decides to break up the couple, using Roderigo as his pawn. Act II A terrible storm strikes Cyprus, and the Turkish fleet is broken apart by the storm. While Othello is still at sea, Cassio arrives. Iago, Desdemona and Emilia follow in another ship. Somehow, Iago and Desdemona enter into an argument about Iago's low opinion of women. Othello arrives at last, and is very glad to see Desdemona. Iago speaks to Roderigo, convincing him that Desdemona will stray from Othello, as she has already done with Cassio. He convinces Roderigo to attack Cassio that night, as he plans to visit mischief on both Othello and Cassio. While on watch together, Iago convinces Cassio to drink, knowing he can't hold his liquor. Iago stokes a fight between Cassio and Roderigo. The ruckus wakes Othello. Iago fills him in, making sure to fictionalize his part in the fight. Cassio laments that he has lost his reputation along with his rank. Iago tries to convince him that if he talks to Desdemona, maybe he can get her to vouch for him with Othello. Iago knows he will be able to turn their friendship against them both. Act III Desdemona pledges to do everything she can to persuade her husband to restore Cassio's rank. Cassio leaves just as Othello enters because he does not wish for a confrontation. Iago seizes on this opportunity to play on Othello's insecurities, making Cassio's exit seem guilty and incriminating. Soon, Othello begins to doubt his wife's fidelity. Desdemona drops the handkerchief that Othello gave her on their honeymoon. Emilia gives it to Iago, who then tells Othello that Cassio has the handkerchief. Othello is incensed to hear that Desdemona would give away something so valuable, and comes to believe that Desdemona is guilty. Othello then swears revenge. Desdemona tells Cassio and Iago that Othello has been acting strangely, and Iago goes to look for him, feigning concern. Emilia thinks that Othello's change has something to do with his jealous nature. Cassio asks Bianca to copy the handkerchief that he found in his room; Cassio has no idea it is Desdemona's. Act IV Othello tries not to condemn Desdemona too harshly. But, soon, Iago whips Othello into an even greater fury through mere insinuation. Iago calls Cassio in, while Othello hides; Iago speaks to Cassio of Bianca, but Othello, in his disturbed state, believes that Cassio is talking of Desdemona. Convinced of her infidelity, Othello is resolved to kill Desdemona himself, and charges Iago with murdering Cassio. When Desdemona mentions Cassio in front of nobleman Lodovico, Othello becomes very angry and slaps her. Othello questions Emilia about Desdemona's guilt, and she swears that Desdemona is pure and true. Emilia thinks that someone has manipulated Othello, however, Iago is there to dispel this opinion. Iago comes across Roderigo; he is not pleased that Iago has failed to deliver on his promises regarding Desdemona. Iago quiets him by making him believe that if he kills Cassio, then he will win Desdemona; Roderigo decides to go along with it, but Iago is coming dangerously close to being revealed. Desdemona knows that she will die soon; she sings a song of sadness and resignation, and decides to give herself to her fate. Act V Spurred on by Iago, Roderigo and Cassio fight, and both are injured badly. Iago enters, pretending that he knows nothing of the scuffle; Gratiano and Lodovico also stumble upon the scene. Roderigo is still alive, so Iago feigns a quarrel, and finishes him off. Bianca comes by, and sees Cassio wounded; Iago makes some remark to implicate her. Cassio is carried away.

A Room With a View,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young English woman, is vacationing with her cousin, Charlotte Bartlett, at an Italian pension for British guests. They are vacationing in Italy together, and currently they are in Florence. While bemoaning the poor views outside their windows, Lucy and Charlotte are interrupted by another guest, an old man by the name of Emerson. Mr. Emerson offers them a room swap; he and his son George are both in rooms that offer beautiful views of Florence. Charlotte refuses; for a woman to accept such an offer from a man would make her indebted to him. It would be a serious breach of propriety. But later that evening, after the intercession of another guest, a clergyman named Mr. Beebe, Charlotte accepts the offer. Their stay in Florence continues, and Lucy continues to run into the eccentric Emersons. They are socially unacceptable by the snobbish standards of the other guests, but Lucy likes them. One day, while Lucy is walking alone in Florence, she witnesses a murder. George happens to be there, too, and he catches her when she faints. On the way home, they have a strange, intimate conversation as they walk along the river. But George stirs up feelings in Lucy that she is not ready to face, and she resolves not to see him again. However, later that week, they both end up on a carriage ride into the hills near Florence. The various British travelers disperse and wander around the hills, and Lucy finds herself alone. She stumbles onto an earth terrace covered with violets, and finds herself face-to-face with George. He kisses her, but the kiss is interrupted by Charlotte. The next day, under Charlotte's direction, Lucy and Charlotte leave for Rome. Part 2 begins after the passage of several months. We are back at Windy Corner, the Honeychurch home in Surrey, England. In Rome, Lucy spent a good deal of time with a man named Cecil Vyse. The Vyses and the Honeychurches are on friendly terms, but Cecil and Lucy only knew each other superficially before Italy. In Italy, Cecil proposed to Lucy twice. She rejected him both times. As Part 2 begins, Cecil is proposing yet again. This time, she accepts. Now that they are engaged, Cecil and Lucy must spend time with Lucy's various neighbors. Cecil, an aristocratic Londoner, despises the ways of the country gentry. He also dislikes Lucy's brother, Freddy, and is not overly fond of Lucy's mother. But Lucy puts up with it. At Charlotte's request, she has never told anyone about her kiss with George. But before too long, the Emersons move into Cissie villa, a home not far from Windy Corner. Lucy is forced to face George Emerson again, but she manages to deal with him at a distance. She continues her engagement to Cecil, even though signs indicate that she is anxious about the marriage on a deep psychological level. To the reader, it is obvious that they are completely unsuitable for each other, but Lucy persists in the engagement. Soon, things come to a head: Charlotte's boiler is broken, and she comes to stay as a guest at Windy Corner. And during her stay, Freddy, who has befriended George, invites George to come play tennis. It is all to take place on Sunday, and Lucy is terrified of what might happen. On Sunday, Cecil refuses to play tennis and pesters everyone by reading aloud from a bad British novel. Lucy soon realizes that the novel is written by Miss Lavish, a woman who stayed at their pension in Florence. Cecil reads a particularly humorous passage aloud, but Lucy sees nothing humorous about it: it is a fictional recreation of her kiss with George. The names are different, but the situation is unmistakable. She realizes that Charlotte told Miss Lavish what happened. George is also present for the reading of the passage. On the way back to the house, George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again. Lucy confronts Charlotte angrily about her indiscretion. She resolves to put George in his place. She has Charlotte sit in the room as support and witness, and she orders George never to return to Windy Corner. George argues with her passionately. He tells her that Cecil is stifling and unsuitable for her; Cecil will never love her enough to want her to be independent. George loves her for who she is. Lucy is shaken by his words, but she stands firm. George leaves, heartbroken. However, later that night, Cecil refuses again to play tennis with Freddy. Something in his refusal makes Lucy see him truthfully for the first time. She breaks off the engagement that very night. But Lucy still cannot admit to anyone, including herself, her feelings for George. Rather than stay at Windy Corner and face George, she resolves to leave for Greece. But one day not long before she is supposed to leave, she goes to church with her mother and Charlotte and meets Mr. Emerson in the minister's study. Mr. Emerson does not know that Lucy has broken off the engagement, but Lucy realizes before long that she cannot lie to the old man. She talks with him, and Mr. Emerson realizes that she has deep feelings for George. He presses the issue, forcing her to confront her own feelings. Finally, she admits that she has been fighting her love for George all along. The novel closes in Florence, where George and Lucy are spending their honeymoon. Not having her mother's consent, Lucy has eloped with George. Things are difficult with her family, but there is hope that it will get better. Whatever happens, George and Lucy have each other, and their life together promises to be full of happiness and love."
A Room with a View,"Our story begins in Florence, Italy, where two English women, Lucy Honeychurch and her spinster cousin Charlotte Bartlett, are at a hotel full of other English tourists. They are displeased with their rooms, which don't have a pleasant view from their windows, but a pair of unconventional fellow guests, Mr. Emerson and his son, George, offers to switch rooms with them. This sparks a whole discussion of what is proper and what is improper, a dialogue that continues throughout the book. Eventually, the women take the Emersons' offer, only after a visiting pastor, Mr. Beebe, convinces Charlotte that it's okay.The majority of the hotel guests are still unconvinced that the Emersons are socially acceptable, though. Lucy, who realizes early on that Mr. Emerson is actually just an old sweetie-pie who doesn't play social games well , is saddened by the attitude of the other guests towards the quirky father-son duo. We see that she's confused and not entirely convinced by the strict rules and regulations of ""good"" society, and that she's tempted to follow her own emotions sometimes, rather than just doing as she's told. She wishes something would happen to her - and it does. She and George both witness a dramatic murder in a Florence square, and both are irreversibly changed by it . This makes Lucy realize that life is not as simple as she'd thought it was up to this point in her life, and she begins to slowly question her belief in the social order she grew up with.The plot gets thicker when the guests at the hotel go on what is meant to be a pleasant drive in the country. When they arrive at their destination, a particularly beautiful ""view"" from a hilltop, everyone wanders off to explore. Lucy inevitably finds George, and, overwhelmed by the beauty of nature and the beauty of Lucy herself, he kisses her. She is shocked! We are shocked! Charlotte, who accidentally witnesses the kiss, is shocked! Part One of the book ends as Charlotte and Lucy beat a quick retreat from Florence, attempting to avoid any further complications with George and his father.Part Two takes us back to Lucy's home in pleasant southern England, Windy Corner. We meet her family , and her stuffy new fiance, Cecil Vyse. Cecil is not exactly a barrel of laughs, but he certainly thinks he is. Through Cecil's devious and rather cruel maneuvering, the Emersons end up moving into the neighborhood. Their previous relationship with Lucy is a total coincidence - Cecil's a fool, not a monster! He doesn't know about Lucy and George's fraught relationship, and he only brings the Emersons to town to provoke a local landowner, who's concerned with finding the ""right"" kind of tenants. Everything converges upon Lucy: George, who she secretly loves , Cecil, who she thinks she loves, her family, Mr. Beebe the pastor, and, to make matters even worse, Charlotte. Windy Corner is suddenly a powder keg of potential drama.The spark that blows the whole thing up is a novel written by Miss Lavish, a fellow traveler they met at the hotel in Florence. In this trashy romance novel, a passionate kiss identical to the one Lucy and George shared is described. Unaware of this awkward fact, Cecil reads the scene out loud - he just thinks the novel's cheesiness is hilarious. However, he doesn't realize that in so doing, he reminds both Lucy and George of their Italian encounter. This inspires George to kiss Lucy a second time when Cecil's momentarily out of the way.Lucy is torn between inexplicably complicated feelings for George and her social obligation to Cecil, which, in her mind, masquerades as love. She sends George away, claiming that she doesn't love him, but he manages to make her see how ridiculous Cecil is. She then realizes that she doesn't love Cecil, and breaks off her engagement with him. All of a sudden, she's down from two suitors to none - and she attempts to resign herself to a life of spinsterhood. She makes desperate plans to travel to Greece, hoping to escape her tumultuous feelings.But when true love comes a-callin', packing up and going to Greece is not the answer . At the last moment, Lucy runs into Mr. Emerson, who comes right out and begs her to face her emotions. She realizes that she's been lying to herself and everyone else - she really does love George. She finally throws off the restrictions and expectations of society and runs off with George. The novel ends where it began, in a room with a view in Florence, with Lucy and George happily united. It's not perfect - Lucy is alienated from her family, who feels that she's acted poorly - but it's still safe to say that love wins out over society in the end."
Mary Barton,"Mary Barton begins in the fields outside Manchester, where two families meet after enjoying a holiday. George and Jane Wilson carry their twin babies, while John Barton accompanies his heavily pregnant wife, Mary. Their 13-year-old daughter, also named Mary, plays nearby. Wilson and Barton invite their wives to sit and chat, while the two men take a walk and discuss Mary's sister, Esther, who ran away from home few nights earlier. John believes that Esther is rotten because her factory wages have given her an unhealthy amount of independence. Meanwhile, 17-year-old Jem Wilson runs by and snatches a kiss from Mary, who slaps his face. The families head to the Barton house to have tea and Mary sends her daughter for provisions and to invite Alice Wilson, George's sister, who works as a sick-nurse. Later that night, Mrs. Barton and her baby die in childbirth, possibly due to ""a shock to her system"" - namely, Esther's disappearance. Three years later, Mary becomes an apprentice dress-maker and John Barton involves himself heavily in the Trades' Union. A year later, Alice introduces Mary, now seventeen and very beautiful, to Margaret Jennings and her grandfather Job Legh. The girls become good friends. Mary learns that Margaret is going blind, but she has a chance to sing for a living instead of sewing, which has become increasingly difficult for her. Meanwhile, Mary attracts the attentions of a wealthy mill-owner's son, Harry Carson. Mary barely speaks to Jem even though he is in love with her. When Carson's mill burns down, George Wilson is out of work and the Wilson family must solely on Jem's income from his job as a mechanic. Soon thereafter, Wilson's twin boys become ill with fever and also die. Mary goes to the family, and when she speaks too comfortingly to Jem, he cannot resist telling her that he loves her. She recoils at his confession at such a tragic time. She returns home and dreams of becoming Mrs. Harry Carson, a wealthy lady who will lift her dear father out of poverty. Meanwhile, John Barton has joined a delegation that will go to London to describe the working man's plight to Parliament. After holding a meeting to plan the delegation's agenda, Barton departs, filled with hope. Mary resolves not to see Harry during her father's absence. However, her confidante, Sally Leadbitter, comes to the Barton home with a letter from Harry. However, Mary has just learned of George Wilson's sudden death. Margaret comes calling soon after and, after weeping over George's demise, tells Mary that she has gotten a singing job. John Barton returns depressed because Parliament refused to see the delegation, and Mary asks Job and Margaret to help comfort her father. Job reads a poem, which Barton asks Mary to copy down, and she does - onto a valentine that Jem had once sent her. Life continues to get worse for the Bartons because John cannot find work. When Mary visits Jane Wilson, she learns that Jem is doing well in Canada and supposedly plans to marry another girl. Mary is distressed by this news, as well as Alice's sudden deafness. Weeks later, Barton runs into the long-lost Esther, who is now a prostitute. She tries to warn him about Harry Carson and Mary. Although he later regrets it, Barton pushes Esther away and she lands in prison for a month. Soon after this event, Jem comes to propose to Mary. When she refuses, he rushes out, telling her not to blame him if he becomes a murderer or drunkard. After Jem is gone, Mary discovers that she loves him. She tells Harry that she does not want to see him anymore. Harry admits that he never intended to marry Mary, but later tells Sally that he will not give Mary up without a fight. Harry continues to pursue Mary, and Jem never visits. Margaret gives Mary the news that she saw Jem on her singing tour and he is doing very well in his work. The next day, Mary visits the Wilsons and Alice's nephew Will, the sailor, arrives. Some days after that, Mary spends a jovial evening with Job, Margaret, Alice and Will, who falls in love with Margaret after hearing her sing. When Esther is released from prison, she tells Jem about Harry Carson and Mary. Jem approaches Harry, asking him his intentions for Mary and the two men quarrel - a policeman has to separate them. To resolve the strike in Manchester, a deputation of workers plead their case in front of the mill owners, who refuse to concede. Harry, a staunch opponent to strike concessions, draws a cruel cartoon of the ragged men. Later in a pub, the striking men plan to take violent action against Harry, drawing lots to see who will be the murderer. Will comes to say goodbye to Mary - he must to walk to the Isle of Man to catch his ship because he has no money for a train ticket. That evening, John Barton, grumpy as ever, goes off on a mysterious errand. Margaret arrives with news that Alice has had a stroke. That same night, the Carson family receives news that Harry has been murdered by a shot to his head. Mary learns that Jem has been arrested as the prime suspect in Harry's murder. To make matters worse, Jane Wilson has unwittingly identified Jem's gun as the murder weapon. When Mary visits Jane, the older woman throws Mary out because she blames the girl for Jem's predicament. Later, Esther brings Mary a piece of evidence she found at the crime scene - a piece of paper that bears Mary's name in Jem's handwriting. After Esther leaves, Mary searches through her father's belongings to find Jem's valentine with the copied verses and realizes that John, not Jem, is the murderer. Mary begins to look for a way to prove Jem's innocence and protect her father from blame. She asks Job Legh about an alibi for Jem and he explains what she must do. Afterwards, Mary goes to Jane Wilson and discovers that Jem had planned to walk with Will to Liverpool on the night of Carson's murder. Job convinces a lawyer, Mr. Bridgenorth, to defend Jem. Job and Mary make plans to travel to Liverpool for the trial, along with Mrs. Wilson. Once in Liverpool, Mary finds out that Will's ship has sailed a day early. She finds out that there is still a chance she can catch up with the boat and rushes to the docks. With the help of several kind sailors, Mary catches up with Will's boat, and he promises to return and testify at Jem's trial. Ben Sturgis, a kind old sailor, takes the exhausted Mary in. Meanwhile, Job is anxious because he has not heard from Mary yet and if Will is not at the trial, Jem will most certainly be convicted. The next morning, the trial begins with Jem's ""not guilty"" plea. The evidence is stacked against him. When Mary is called to the witness stand, she proclaims her love for Jem and voices her regret for the dalliance with Harry Carson. Will arrives suddenly and testifies that Jem was with him the night of the murder - and this crucial information exonerates Jem. Meanwhile, the stress and fatigue has made Mary delirious and Mr. and Mrs. Sturgis look after her. Jem must go to Manchester to see Alice, who is dying. After Mary recovers, she returns home to care for her father. John Barton, who has not long to live, realizes that even though Jem has not been convicted of Harry's murder, the trial has sullied his reputation and affected his job prospects. Barton finally confesses his guilt to Mr. Carson, Job, Jem, and Mary and asks them all for forgiveness. At first, Mr. Carson refuses, but later, he reads the Bible and has an epiphany. Carson returns to the Barton home and forgives the sickly man for killing his son - moments before Barton dies. Jem gets a job in Canada and prepares to move there with Mary. Meanwhile, Mr. Carson has seen the error of his ways and starts trying to help improve the lives of the factory workers. Esther returns to the Barton home and dies there. Years later, Jem and Mary are happily married and living in Canada with their son, Johnnie. Margaret has an operation that restores her eyesight and she becomes engaged to Will Wilson."
Around the World in Eighty Days,"Phileas Fogg never misses a beat . He's punctual, practical, and more than a bit obsessed with Father Time. Being a lonely bachelor in an old mansion in London doesn't seem to bother him, though. With the peace and quiet he is able to contemplate the more important things in life, like having his shaving water brought to him at the exact same temperature each day, or calculating precisely how many steps there are between his gentleman's club and his front door. Yeah... awesome... OCD aside, Phileas Fogg has two passions: playing whist and being right. So when a debate between his homies at the club arises about how long it would take to travel around the world, he dismissively states that of course it could be accomplished in eighty days. With much scoffing and bwa-ha-ha-ing, his friends politely tell him he's off his rocker. It's 1872 after all. But Phileas sets down a bet and calls them out. He wagers 20,000 pounds that he can do it. And because rich dudes in London have nothing better to do, they all agree to the bet. Meanwhile, a suspicious looking ""gentleman"" has robbed the Bank of England. Oddly enough, he kind of sort of looks like Phileas Fogg--oh, and he has that reserved, subdued quality which totally identifies him as a gentleman. Hmm... now said gentleman is looking to quickly leave the country. Detective Fix, a police officer from Scotland Yard is now on the case to pursue and arrest Phileas Fogg for burglary, but he has to catch him first. Phileas and his newly hired servant, Passepartout, leave that night with Detective Fix slyly following them. The adventure continues as Passepartout makes constant goof-ups, they stop to help an Indian princess in distress, and Fogg duels with an American colonel, all the while barely evading Detective Fix. It's around the world at Warp Tour speed as Phileas Fogg stops at nothing to make it back home in time. He's down to use everything from ships, trains, an elephant, or a sailing sled to get them to the right place at the right time. His calm, logical, gentlemanly demeanor never freaks out or fusses over the many delays, inconveniences, and dangerous modes of travel. Fix is able to arrest Fogg at the worst possible moment, and now it's way too late to collect on the bet. Instead of jumping off a bridge, Phileas agrees to get hitched to his Indian Princess friend--so maybe this isn't the end of the world as he had previously thought. But Passepartout realizes something: Phileas Fogg, the most punctual man in the world, did not account for the time gained by traveling eastward. So they still have time to win a bet. Phileas Fogg storms his club and astonishes his cronies by making the journey around the world, just like he said. But what he's most happy about is finding someone to love and who loves him back."
Candide,"Endowed with an ""honest mind"" and ""great simplicity of heart,"" Candide lives in the castle of the Baron of Westphalia. He is rumored to be the illegitimate son of the Baroness, an imposing three hundred and fifty-pound woman. His tutor Pangloss instills in him a doctrine of optimism whereby ""everything is for the best."" One day, the Baron discovers Candide and Miss Cunegonde, the attractive daughter of the Baron, kissing behind a screen and banishes Candide from the castle. In despair over his newfound state of exile, Candide finds consolation in a tavern with two men, who invite him to dinner. But they soon put him in shackles and consign him to the army of the King of the Bulgars. Candide escapes from the Bulgar army during a gruesome battle with the neighboring Abares and travels to Holland, where Jacques the Anabaptist charitably takes Candide under his care. Walking in the street, Candide tosses a few coins to a beggar in the street, who reveals himself to be Pangloss. He informs Candide that Miss Cunegonde has been raped and killed. When Candide challenges Pangloss to reconcile his personal misfortune with his doctrine of optimism, Pangloss rationalizes his own condition as a ""necessary ingredient."" Jacques later dies when thrown overboard trying to help a sailor tossed by the tempest. At an Auto-da-fe, a public ceremony of repentance and humiliation, Candide is flogged and Pangloss hanged. An Old Woman nurses Candide's wounds and later escorts him to see Miss Cunegonde, who has survived, contrary to Pangloss's story. Miss Cunegonde recounts a brutal rape at Westphalia and her enslavement to Jewish merchant Don Issachar. The Grand Inquisitor takes notice of Miss Cunegonde at mass and insists on a shared living arrangement with Don Issachar. He invites her to an Auto-da-fe where, in horror, she witnesses the torture of Candide and apparent execution of Pangloss. Don Issachar discovers Candide and Miss Cunegonde lying together on the sofa and draws a dagger. Candide drives a long sword into the Israelite, killing him instantly. At that instant, the Grand Inquisitor walks in. Without hesitation, Candide drives the sword through his other rival. The Old Woman suggests that they escape by horseback. They stop at a tavern where Miss Cunegonde's jewels and diamonds are stolen. Once again penniless, they ruminate on Pangloss's philosophy. The Old Woman tells them of being enslaved in Morocco. In a gory battle between competing native tribes, everyone is slain except her. She is subsequently sold to a string of merchants, finally landing in the custody of a janissary whose fort is blockaded by Russian forces and starved to the point of famine. Later liberated, she is healed by a French surgeon. Despite past hardships, the Old Woman disavows any self-pitying stance. Upon their arrival by ship to Buenos Ayres, the resident Governor Don Fernando becomes instantly smitten with Miss Cunegonde. In private, Fernando makes a declaration of love. The Old Woman advises Miss Cunegonde to take the hand of the wealthy governor. Agents of the Grand Inquisitor arrive in Buenos Ayres in search of Miss Cunegonde and Candide, seeking retribution. The Old Woman urges Miss Cunegonde even more strongly to marry the Governor and seek his protection. Candide makes a swift escape with his footman Cacambo, who leads him to Paraguay. They land themselves in the company of the Reverend Father Commandant, who turns out to be Miss Cunegonde's brother. Candide informs him that his sister resides in Buenos Ayres. Overjoyed by the prospect of seeing Miss Cunegonde again, the Baron turns sour, however, when Candide reveals his intention to marry her. In an access of rage, Candide draws a sword and plunges it into the Baron. Cacambo helps him escape from the scene of the crime. They head toward Cayenne along a river route through ""a chain of inaccessible mountains,"" arriving in the magical land of El Dorado. During a tour of the city, Candide and Cacambo learn that the country has neither judges nor legislators. The King grants them permission to leave after a month, recognizing the inherent liberty of all men. Candide and Cacambo take sheep and jewels with them as bargaining chips to get Miss Cunegonde back from Governor Don Fernando. Considered worthless in El Dorado, the jewels make them ten times richer than any monarch in Europe. Candide sends Cacambo to bargain with the Governor for the custody of Miss Cunegonde. The three of them will reunite in Venice. Mynheer Vanderdendur, a Dutch trader, steals the diamond-loaded sheep, leaving Candide penniless in Surinam. Candide pays Martin, a poor German scholar, to accompany him to Venice. They spot two ships engaged in battle, one belonging to the Dutch pirate. Candide reclaims some of the diamonds and sheep before Mynheer's ship sinks. Candide seizes upon the incident to reinforce his optimistic view of the world. But Martin points out that several innocent passengers also died. In Paris, the Abbe of Perigord brings Candide and Martin to a playhouse. The performance moves Candide to tears, while a critic excoriates Candide for being too sentimental. The three men attend a soiree at the home of the lead actress. Among the guests is the Marchioness of Parolignac. A man of letters outlines what he considers to be the inviolable rules of good literature. Dazzled by his brilliance, Candide declares him the ""second Pangloss."" After dinner, Marchioness of Parolignac attempts to seduce Candide in her dressing room. Candide later confesses his infidelity to the Abbe of Perigord, who assuages his sense of guilt. The next morning, he receives a missive from Miss Cunegonde, who has arrived at Bordeaux with Cacambo and the Old Woman. Candide rushes to see her, but is told that she cannot bear light or speak. A maid uncovers Miss Cunegonde's hand from beneath a bedsheet. At that moment, an officer enters the room and arrests Candide. Martin realizes that they have been swindled. Candide, wishing to avoid legal entanglements, bribes an officer to escort him out of prison to catch a ferryboat headed toward Portsmouth. Nearing the shoreline, Candide witnesses an English admiral being put to death on the deck of a ship. Horrified to learn that there is no legitimate reason for the execution, he asks the captain to carry him directly to Venice. In Venice, Candide looks in vain for Cacambo. Martin chastises Candide for his naivete, claiming that ""there is very little virtue or happiness in this world."" Candide disputes Martin's claim by pointing out a seemingly happy couple passing in the street. They invite the couple to dinner and make a bet between themselves about the couple's happiness. The woman is Paquette, Miss Cunegonde's former maidservant, who recounts her own tale of mistreatment after the pillaging of the castle of Westphalia. Candide then turns to the man, Friar Giroflee, who lives a profoundly miserable existence in a monastery. Martin appears to have won the wager, but Candide clings to his faith that he will again see Miss Cunegonde. They next visit Senator Pococurante, a wealthy man who dislikes everything he possesses. Candide takes great offense at his systematic trashing of such literary geniuses as Homer, Virgil, and Milton. Senator Pococurante is a man who takes ""pleasure in having no pleasure."" Candide tries to keep faith that he will be reunited with his beloved. One evening, while dining in a tavern, Candide catches a glimpse of Cacambo. He is disappointed to learn that Miss Cunegonde is in Constantinople, and worse, Cacambo has fallen back into the servitude of Sultan Achmet. Cacambo makes arrangements for Candide to sail to Constantinople aboard the ship of his master. Miss Cunegonde has become the slave of Ragotsky, a Transylvanian prince, and turned horribly ugly. Candide is undeterred in his love. Once they reach Bosphorus, they examine a row of slaves, two of whom closely resemble Pangloss and the Baron. At the mention of their names, the two men rise up in shouts of glee. The five men find Miss Cunegonde and the Old Woman in Propontis. Candide gasps at her ugliness, but keeps his promise to marry her. When he informs the Baron of his intention, the Baron again refuses to allow the union. Candide sends the Baron back into slavery and legally consummates the marriage without his consent. After so many misfortunes, they expect an era of happiness, but instead lapse into boredom. Candide concludes that hard work is the ""only way of rendering life bearable We must cultivate our garden."" And so all members of the household put their talents to use and finally enjoy the fruits of their labor."
Around the World in 80 Days,"Mr. Phileas Fogg is a wealthy man living in London who is part of the Reform Club, an elite social organization. He has recently hired a new domestic servant, a Frenchman named Passepartout. While at the Reform Club, he makes a bet with the other club members that it is possible to go around the world by train and steamer in just eighty days, and that he himself can do it. Since 20,000 pounds are at stake, he fetches Passepartout and they head off right away to circumnavigate the globe. Waiting for Fogg at the Suez Canal, where he will take a steamer to Bombay, India, is a detective named Fix; apparently, Fogg has been accused of robbing the Bank of England. He follows Fogg and Passepartout on the steamer Mongolia to India, where he hopes to receive a warrant to arrest Fogg as the robber. The steamer arrives in Bombay two days ahead of schedule, but the arrest warrant has not yet arrived. While waiting for the train that will take them across India from Bombay to Calcutta, Passepartout wanders off into a Hindu temple, hoping to see some of the city's sights before they rush off again. He does not realize that because he is a Christian, he is forbidden to enter; in addition, he enters it with shoes on, which is also not allowed. He narrowly escapes the wrath of the priests and makes it to the train station in time. On the train, Fogg and Passepartout meet Sir Francis Cromarty, an Englishman who lives in India. Passepartout spends much time gazing out the window at the wild jungles of India. Suddenly, though, the train stops--apparently there is a 50-mile span of track that is not yet finished, and passengers must arrange their own transportation to the next point where they can board a train again. In a nearby village, Fogg purchases an elephant from an Indian man and hires a Parsee guide to lead them. The group, now including Sir Francis, starts off on the elephant, and after camping for a night they encounter a group of tribal Indians preparing to sacrifice a young woman whose husband, a prince, has just died. Fogg decides they need to use the time they have gained to try and save her, and after a number of failed efforts Passepartout disguises himself as the dead prince's corpse and manages to jump up and grab Aouda before they can throw her on the funeral pyre. They make it to Calcutta, but are immediately arrested. At first they think it is because of what happened with Aouda, but actually, Fix has gotten them detained because of Passepartout breaking the law back in Bombay by entering the Hindu temple. Fogg bails them out with a large sum of money and they get on the steamer to Hong Kong. Fix follows them on, knowing that Hong Kong will be the last bit of British territory they step into, and thus the last chance to arrest Fogg. A storm delays them in reaching Hong Kong, but thankfully the steamer to Yokohama, Japan will not be leaving until the following evening, since it needs time for repairs. Fix decides that it is time to get Passepartout on his side, and takes him to a tavern to tell him whom his master really is. Passepartout is ever loyal, though, and does not believe that Fogg is the robber. Determined to keep Fogg in Hong Kong until he can arrest him, Fix gives Passepartout a dose of opium and he passes out for a long time, thus unable to notify his master of what someone at the port told him: that the steamer would be leaving form Yokohama in the morning instead of the following evening. The next day, Fogg realizes that Passepartout is missing, and that the steamer has sailed without them. He hires a sailor to take them to Shanghai, where they can catch the steamer that will sail to San Francisco before it makes its stop in Yokohama. Aouda is with him, since it appears the family member she knew in Hong Kong moved away. Fix, posing as a friend, accompanies them. A storm delays them, and they make it to Shanghai just as the steamer is pulling out of the harbor. Meanwhile, Passepartout managed to get on the steamer to Yokohama, even in his disoriented state. He is distraught when he realizes he left his master behind. In Yokohama, he tries to join a traveling circus troupe in order to make money to buy himself food--while doing this, though, Fogg finds him. They managed to flag down the steamer in Shanghai and get on. The entire group, Fix included, gets on the steamer to San Francisco. Aouda is slowly growing more and more attached to Fogg. They make it to San Francisco and get on a train that will take them to New York, but not before witnessing a political skirmish in which Fogg nearly ends up fighting an American man named Colonel Stamp Proctor. The train takes them through the great American wilderness, and they encounter a delay when they come upon a bridge that is too weak to hold the train's weight. They decide to speed the train over the bridge anyway, and it collapses right after they get over. A bigger problem comes further along in the trip, when a tribe of Sioux Indians attacks the train. They reach an army fort and the soldiers fight off the Native Americans, but not before they kidnap Passepartout and a few of the other train passengers. Fogg goes after him with an army of soldiers, whom he promises a reward to for their aid. It takes him a long while to return, and the train leaves without them; Aouda and Fix stay behind to wait. Eventually he comes back with Passepartout, safe. To catch up with the train, they take a sledge across the snowy prairie to the next train station. They reach New York on the train, but because of all the delays the steamer to Liverpool, England had left forty-five minutes before. In a last-ditch effort to win his bet, Fogg pays the owner of a cargo ship to take them along to his destination in Bordeaux; once they get aboard, though, Fogg bribes the crew, ties up the captain, and turns the ship toward Liverpool. The problem is, going this fast they will never have enough fuel to make it; Fogg offers to buy the ship from the captain for a huge amount of money so that he can tear it apart and burn bits of it to keep up their speed. They burn enough to make it to Queenstown, Ireland, where they take a train to Dublin and mail boats to Liverpool, allowing them to make ti there faster. As soon as they reach English territory, however, Fix arrests and detains Fogg for allegedly robbing the Bank of England. It now seems like there is no way for Fogg to reach London in time to win his bet. Soon, however, Fix realizes that the real bank robber was arrested three days before; breathless, he runs to free Fogg and tell him to get to London as quickly as possible. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout hire an express train to get them to the British capital as quickly as possible. But they do not make it in time--they arrive in the London station a few minutes too late. Fogg does not know what to do now that he has lost his wager, and he sits alone in his room for a long time. Aouda comes to speak to him, however, and reveals her love for him--Fogg says that he would like nothing more than to make her his wife. Overjoyed, they tell Passepartout to go make wedding arrangements for the following day, Monday, with the reverend. Once there, however, Passepartout realizes while talking to him that the following day is actually Sunday; they had gained a day when crossing the International Date Line. That meant that that day was Saturday, the day Fogg had to return to London in order to win his wager. Fogg rushes to the Reform Club and arrives just in time to win the bet and earn back his fortune. He believes that the greatest thing about taking the trip, however, was that he found Aouda."
Sister Carrie,"Caroline Meeber, known as Carrie, leaves her home at age eighteen and takes the train to Chicago. The man sitting behind her on the train, named Drouet, starts talking to her. Carrie soon becomes interested in him due to his fine clothing and manners. Upon arriving in Chicago she says goodbye to him, but not before she has given him her address. Carrie meets her sister Minnie Hanson and moves into one of the rooms in Minnie's apartment. Mr. Hanson arrives home that night but does not pay too much attention to her. Carrie soon realizes that the Hansons expect her to find a job and pay them rent. As far as they are concerned, she is supplemental income. After the weekend she enters the commercial part of the city and starts looking for a job. Being naturally timid, Carrie is frightened of entering the factories and shops and asking for a job, the result being that she is not hired that day. After several days of searching she finds employment in a shoe factory. Carrie works hard at her job, but discovers that the salary is too low for her to pay rent and purchase clothes for the winter. She soon falls ill from the cold and takes several days to recover. Assuming that she has lost her new job, Carrie returns to the streets in the desperate hopes of finding new employment, but becomes frustrated when nothing is available. Almost ready to head home, Carrie accidentally meets Drouet on the street. He kindly offers her a meal and takes her to a fine restaurant. After much insisting he convinces her to meet him again the next day and presses twenty dollars into her hand. Carrie is loath to take the money and afraid that Minnie will find out where she got it, so instead of spending the money she decides to return it to Drouet. She meets him again the next day and he takes her out shopping, buying her an entire wardrobe in the process. Carrie is so elated by the way he treats her that she agrees to allow him to rent an apartment for her. She sneaks her things out of Minnie's house, leaving only a short note behind, and takes off. Things go well with Drouet for a while. Drouet then introduces Carrie to his friend Hurstwood, the manager of one of the top bars in the city. Hurstwood is far more refined and elegant than Drouet, and soon he comes over to play cards with Carrie and Drouet. He next offers to take them to the theater. When Drouet is away, Hurstwood begins to stop by the apartment and woo Carrie, finally getting her to kiss him while on a buggy ride. He falls madly in love with her and starts to think of getting her to run away with him. Drouet, unaware of what is going on between Carrie and Hurstwood, returns to Chicago for several weeks. He is asked to find a girl to perform in his Mason's lodge play and asks Carrie if she would do it. She agrees, and Hurstwood get together all the top people in the city to watch her perform. Carrie puts on a stunning performance as a result of Drouet's support for her, but Hurstwood starts to become insanely jealous when he sees them together. Hurstwood's family life falls apart rapidly as he has been neglecting his wife in order to see Carrie. She finally realizes what is going on and demands that he give her money. Meanwhile, Drouet has also discovered that Carrie has been spending far more time with Hurstwood then he ever thought. Drouet angrily walks out on Carrie, and Hurstwood foolishly fights with his wife, not realizing that his wife has the entire property in her name. She then files for divorce, hires a detective, and locks him out of the house. Hurstwood goes to his workplace and spends his nights at a local hotel. One evening he is locking up the bar and discovers that the safe is unlocked. He pulls out over ten thousand dollars in cash and accidentally locks the safe before he can put the money back. Without thinking he takes the cash and rushes to Carrie's apartment. He tells her that Drouet has had an accident and that they need to go to the hospital. With that lie he gets her onto a train heading to Detroit and from there to Montreal. Carrie is upset and furious with him, but passively does nothing to resist. From Montreal they head to New York City where Hurstwood rents an apartment for them. He has sent back most of the money he stole while in Montreal in order to avoid prosecution, keeping only thirteen hundred in order to establish his own business. He soon finds a bar looking for a business partner and buys a one-third stake for one thousand. Things are fine until the owner of the land that the bar is on decides to kick them out and build an office building. Hurstwood only has seven hundred dollars and struggles to find new employment. He and Carrie are soon forced to move into a smaller apartment. Failing to find work, Hurstwood slowly degenerates into idleness. He takes up some gambling and loses over a hundred dollars in one night. Carrie loses interest in him as a person and starts considering her other alternatives. Things get progressively worse until Hurstwood does not even leave the apartment anymore, preferring to sit around in his old clothes. When Hurstwood is almost out of money, Carrie decides that she will have to get a job to support them. After a few days she is given a spot in the chorus line of a Broadway show. Her salary is barely enough for them to live on, but Hurstwood scrapes by. She is soon promoted to lead the chorus line and later to an even better paying dancing position. Carrie refuses to tell Hurstwood about her success because she need the extra money to purchase clothes for herself. Hurstwood takes one last job when the trolley car workers go on strike. He applies for a position and becomes a scab, a man who works when everyone else is striking. However, an angry mob soon manages to stop his car and after being shot at he decides to give up and head home. Carrie luckily is given a speaking part one day and at that point decides to leave Hurstwood in order to live with an actress friend of hers. She moves out while he is taking a walk. The rest of the novel traces Carrie's rise and Hurstwood's fall. He soon loses the apartment and is forced to become a homeless beggar who stays in cheap hotels in the Bowery part of town. Carrie meanwhile is given a silent role, but plays it so well that she becomes an overnight star and signs a contract paying her a hundred and fifty dollars a week, an exorbitant sum for her. Drouet moves to New York and tries to reestablish his relationship with Carrie, but she brushes him off. Hurstwood, in despair, commits suicide by gassing himself with methane in his hotel room one night. His wife and daughter take a voyage to Rome with a wealthy young man that his daughter has married while his dead body is carted away on a ship. Carrie meanwhile has become unhappy with her state in the world, wishing that she could perform drama rather than comedy."

Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, has overseen the affairs of Kellynch Hall since her mother's death thirteen years ago. Sir Walter feels closest to Elizabeth, who shares his values and good looks. Anne's opinion is valued very little. As for the youngest daughter Mary, she lives with the Musgroves -- her husband Charles' family -- at Uppercross. After Lady Elliot's death, the Elliots have accumulated debt steadily. At the novel's opening, the debt has reached a point that requires the Elliots to reform their lifestyle thoroughly. Two family friends, Mr. Shepherd and Lady Russell, are called in for advice. After some discussion and negotiations, it is decided that the Elliots will let Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft and move to a smaller place in Bath. At Bath, the Elliots will able to maintain a dignified lifestyle at lesser expense. Incidentally, it is decided that Mrs. Clay will accompany Sir Walter and Elizabeth to Bath. Mrs. Clay is a daughter of Mr. Shepherd who excels at the art of pleasing . Although she is a widow and not very pretty, Anne and Lady Russell fear that she and Sir Walter may become involved with her romantically. Anne, meanwhile, goes to Uppercross at Mary's request. At Michaelmas, the Crofts move into Kellynch Hall. As it turns out, Mrs. Croft is the sister of Frederick Wentworth, with whom Anne fell in love seven years ago. The affectionate feelings between Captain Wentworth and Anne were true and strong. At the time, however, the captain had neither fortune nor title to his name. Anne was thus persuaded by Lady Russell to break off the relationship. Now, Captain Wentworth has returned to visit the Crofts at Kellynch Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove are eager to meet Captain Wentworth because their deceased son Richard once served under him. Once the acquaintance is made, the captain's fine character delights the Musgroves. The captain thus becomes a frequent visitor at Uppercross, where the young Miss Musgroves Henrietta and Louisa delight in his company. Whereas Henrietta was previously on particularly good terms with Charles Hayter -- a cousin and clergyman -- she now devotes her attention to Captain Wentworth. As for Anne, she exchanges only polite remarks with Captain Wentworth. Neither Anne nor the captain give a sign that one remains interested in the other. Eventually, Henrietta returns to Charles Hayter and marks Louisa for Captain Wentworth. One day, a party from Uppercross decides to visit Lyme, where Captain Wentworth's friend Captain Harville lives. Everyone is impressed by the heartfelt welcome that the Harvilles extend to their guests. On this trip, Captain Wentworth appears to grow closer to Louisa, whereas Anne makes the acquaintance of Captain Benwick and spends the evening discussing romantic poetry with him. The next day, the party realizes that they have been staying at the same inn as Mr. Elliot, the heir presumptive of the Elliot family. Mr. Elliot was previously expected to marry Elizabeth but instead chose to marry a wealthy common woman. Later in the day, Louisa has an accident and receives severe contusions to the head. It is decided that she must remain with the Harvilles to recover. Anne returns to Uppercross with Captain Wentworth, who is impressed by her calmness during the aftermath of Louisa's incident. Anne leaves Uppercross with Lady Russell on the following day. When Anne arrives at Camden Place in Bath, where the Elliots have taken a house, she is met with an unexpectedly warm welcome. Sir Walter and Elizabeth are in particularly good spirits from their recent reconciliation with Mr. Elliot. Whereas Lady Russell finds it natural for Mr. Elliot to wish to be on good terms with Sir Walter, Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives for visiting Camden Place. In any case, he is a sensible, cultivated man, and his company is pleasant. What worries Anne is the favorable position that Mrs. Clay seems to have secured in the eyes of Sir Walter. One morning, the Bath papers announce the arrival of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter, the Honorable Miss Carteret.

Meanwhile, Anne renews an old friendship with Mrs. Smith, who has been left destitute by her late husband's overspending. In February, a letter from Mary announces Louisa's engagement to Captain Benwick. The news both surprises and pleases Anne -- Captain Wentworth, after all, is now free. When the Crofts arrive at Bath, Admiral Croft declares that they must have Captain Wentworth come to Bath as well. One day, Anne runs into the captain at the local confectionary. Although they exchange only brief words, they meet again at a party hosted by Lady Dalrymple. Over the course of the evening, it becomes clear to Anne that Captain Wentworth still loves her -- and that he is jealous of Mr. Elliot.

Looking Backward,"Julian West, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century. The gap between the rich and poor was vast and seemingly impossible to remedy through any means. Like other members of his class, Julian thought himself superior to the toiling masses, and he regarded their frequent strikes with anger and contempt. Julian was engaged to Edith Bartlett, a beautiful, graceful Boston aristocrat. They planned to marry when the construction of their new home was completed, but the frequent strikes by the building trades had delayed their marriage for over a year. Julian, a sufferer of insomnia, had secretly built an underground sleeping chamber to shield himself from street noises. He also enlisted the aid of Doctor Pillsbury, a skilled mesmerist, who never failed to leave Julian in a deep sleep. Pillsbury trained Julian's servant, Sawyer, to revive Julian from a mesmerized sleep. The night before Pillsbury left Boston for a new job in New Orleans, Julian enlisted his help one last time. After Pillsbury left, Julian's home was destroyed by a fire; Julian was protected by his underground chamber. Because no one knew of his chamber, Julian was assumed dead. Over one hundred years later, Julian's secret chamber is discovered by Doctor Leete, who was preparing the site for the construction of a new laboratory. Julian has not aged a day because he has been in a state of suspended animation. Doctor Leete revives him and takes him into his home. Julian quickly learns that twentieth-century society is vastly different from that of the nineteenth century. The economy is based on publicly owned capital rather than private, as was the case in Julian's day. The government controls the means of production and divides the national product equally between all citizens. Every citizen receives a college-level education. Individuals are given a great deal of freedom in choosing a career, and everyone retires at the age of forty-five. Society is based on an ideal of the brotherhood of man, and it is unthinkable that any individual should suffer the evils of poverty or hunger. With Doctor Leete's guidance, Julian comes to understand and appreciate the twentieth-century society. Meanwhile, Julian learns that Doctor Leete's daughter, Edith is the great-granddaughter of Edith Bartlett. Julian and Edith become engaged, much to Doctor Leete's pleasure. Julian has a terrible nightmare, in which he dreams that his transportation to the twentieth century was nothing but a dream. He finds himself trapped again in the cruel and inhumane world of the nineteenth century. To his great distress, he now sees all of the horrendous faults of nineteenth-century society. He tries to explain to his friends--Edith Bartlett and her family-- why their society is so awful and cruel, and how it can be transformed into something much better. However, they are only frightened and angered, so they expel Julian from their company. When Julian wakes from this nightmare to discover that his trip to the twentieth century was not just a dream, he is greatly relieved."

Utilitarianism,"John Stuart Mill's theory of utilitarianism is an ethical landmark that is still popularly taught and utilized today. Reformulating the ethical theory first articulated by Jeremy Bentham, Mill introduces important nuances that arguably strengthen the utilitarian stance. In particular, Mill diverges from Bentham by asserting that there are qualitatively different pleasures, and that these ought to be weighed differently in the course of ethical reasoning. Even if one does not agree with utilitarianism, the view is important because it is able to unite the ethical sense of people across different cultures; indeed, it is difficult to deny that pleasure and pain are fundamental to the human condition, and to ethics."
Where Angels Fear to Tread,"Where Angels Fear to Tread opens with Lilia, a young unsophisticated widow, being dropped off at the train station by her in-laws: the domineering Mommy Dearest Mrs. Herriton and her children, Philip and Harriet. They are sending her on a trip to Italy with the young but trustworthy Caroline Abbott, to prevent her from making a bad match in England. Yup, we're back in those days. Hello, Edwardian-era repression. You look really uncomfortable in that corset. Okay, this book deals with two completely different worlds. On one side, we have the stifling world of Sawston, England, your typical small town full of dust, good manners and narrow-minded gossips. Life in Sawston is not attractive. It's conventional and dull. People pretend to be virtuous, but they usually care more about keeping up appearances than actually doing the right thing. It's a couple of degrees removed from Stepford. Our Sawston cast includes Mrs. Herriton. She's the kind of tyrannical matriarch you'd never want as your mother-in-law, and exemplifies the hypocrisy of English society. The Herriton family tries to mold Lilia into a respectable member of society, but they fail bigtime. So now they're trying to get Lilia out of the way so that they can mold her daughter Irma, who is still young enough to be influenced. Given the suffocating atmosphere of Sawston, we can hardly blame Lilia for wanting to escape. On the other side, we have Monteriano, a pretty Italian town ""where one really does feel in the heart of things, and off the beaten track."" The Italians are full of passion and know how to live life to the fullest. The problem with Monteriano is that--even though it's beautiful and a stark contrast to the repressed ol' England--it's hard to say whether it is morally good. Certainly its customs are way different than Sawston's, and it's hard for an Englishwoman to navigate. Lilia marries the handsome but selfish Italian, Gino Carella and she soon finds herself in an unhappy marriage with little personal freedom. The cultural struggle between England and Italy becomes more and more heated, and we're not sure exactly who comes out on top. After the unexpected death of Lilia during childbirth, the fate of her newborn son becomes the main plot-line for the remainder of the novel. Yeah: Where Angels Fear To Tread is one big custody battle. Mrs. Herriton sends Philip and his sister Harriet off to Italy to rescue the ""poor"" child from his ""uneducated"" father. And no, we didn't just discover scare quotes: everything Mrs. Herriton says is so unbelievably off the mark that we feel the need to put bunny ears on most of her words. But Caroline suspects that Mrs. Herriton's motives aren't pure--and she's right. Mrs. Herriton only wants to preserve her reputation in the eyes of society, but she doesn't in fact care a bit about the baby. What follows is series of events, at times funny, in which Philip, Harriet, and Caroline attempt to persuade Gino to part with his son. This section of the book would be awesome set to the Benny Hill song. When their efforts prove futile, Harriet decides to take matters into her own hands and kidnaps the child. But as fate would have it, their carriage overturns and the poor baby is killed. Ouch. Caroline manages to restore peace between a grief-stricken Gino and a repentant Philip. And the novel concludes with Philip about to express his feelings to Caroline during their train ride back to Sawston. But Forster denies us the ""Love Conquers All"" ending by having Caroline confess that she has fallen for Gino. Sadly, there's no happy ending on the horizon for these two lovebirds. Womp womp."
Oliver Twist,"Oliver Twist is the story of a young orphan, Oliver, and his attempts to stay good in a society that refuses to help. Oliver is born in a workhouse, to a mother not known to anyone in the town. She dies right after giving birth to him, and he is sent to the parochial orphanage, where he and the other orphans are treated terribly and fed very little. When he turns nine, he is sent to the workhouse, where again he and the others are treated badly and practically starved. The other boys, unable to stand their hunger any longer, decide to draw straws to choose who will have to go up and ask for more food. Oliver loses. On the appointed day, after finishing his first serving of gruel, he goes up and asks for more. Mr. Bumble, the beadle, and the board are outraged, and decide they must get rid of Oliver, apprenticing him to the parochial undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry. It is not great there either, and after an attack on his mother's memory, Oliver runs away. Oliver walks towards London. When he is close, he is so weak he can barely continue, and he meets another boy named Jack Dawkins, or the artful Dodger. The Dodger tells Oliver he can come with him to a place where a gentleman will give him a place to sleep and food, for no rent. Oliver follows, and the Dodger takes him to an apartment in London where he meets Fagin, the aforementioned gentleman, and Oliver is offered a place to stay. Oliver eventually learns that Fagin's boys are all pickpockets and thieves, but not until he is wrongfully accused of their crime of stealing an old gentleman's handkerchief. He is arrested, but the bookseller comes just in time to the court and says that he saw that Oliver did not do it. The gentleman whose handkerchief was taken, Mr. Brownlow, feels bad for Oliver, and takes him in. Oliver is very happy with Mr. Brownlow, but Fagin and his co-conspirators are not happy to have lost Oliver, who may give away their hiding place. So one day, when Mr. Brownlow entrusts Oliver to return some books to the bookseller for him, Nancy spots Oliver, and kidnaps him, taking him back to Fagin. Oliver is forced to go on a house-breaking excursion with the intimidating Bill Sikes. At gun point Oliver enters the house, with the plan to wake those within, but before he can, he is shot by one of the servants. Sikes and his partner escape, leaving Oliver in a ditch. The next morning Oliver makes it back to the house, where the kind owner, Mrs. Maylie, and her beautiful niece Rose, decide to protect him from the police and nurse him back to health. Oliver slowly recovers, and is extremely happy and grateful to be with such kind and generous people, who in turn are ecstatic to find that Oliver is such a good-natured boy. When he is well enough, they take him to see Mr. Brownlow, but they find his house empty--he has moved to the West Indies. Meanwhile, Fagin and his mysterious partner Monks have not given up on finding Oliver, and one day Oliver wakens from a nightmare to find them staring at him through his window. He raises the alarm, but they escape. Nancy, overhearing Fagin and Monks, decides that she must go to Rose Maylie to tell her what she knows. She does so, telling Rose that Monks is Oliver's half-brother, who has been trying to destroy Oliver so that he can keep his whole inheritance, but that she will not betray Fagin or Sikes. Rose tells Mr. Brownlow, who tells Oliver's other caretakers, and they decide that they must meet Nancy again to find out how to find Monks. They meet her on London Bridge at a prearranged time, but Fagin has become suspicious, and has sent his new boy, Noah Claypole, to spy on Nancy. Nancy tells Rose and Mr. Brownlow how to find Monks, but still refuses to betray Fagin and Sikes, or to go with them. Noah reports everything to Fagin, who tells Sikes, knowing full well that Sikes will kill Nancy. He does. Mr. Brownlow has in the mean time found Monks, who finally admits everything that he has done, and the true case of Oliver's birth. Sikes is on the run, but all of London is in an uproar, and he eventually hangs himself accidentally in falling off a roof, while trying to escape from the mob surrounding him. Fagin is arrested and tried, and, after a visit from Oliver, is executed. Oliver, Mr. Brownlow, and the Maylies end up living in peace and comfort in a small village in the English countryside."

Dr. Strong and Annie go through some difficult times when Uriah hints that Annie may be having an affair with her cousin, Jack Maldon. However, Mr. Dick reconciles the two, and they go back to being very affectionate. This episode only deepens the disliking of Uriah, and soon he is exposed as a fraud and taken down by Mr. Micawber and Traddles. Meanwhile, Mr. Peggotty and David hear from Littimer, Steerforth's servant, that Little Em'ly has run away from Steerforth. They ask her friend Martha for help finding her, and Martha eventually finds Little Em'ly and leads Mr. Peggotty to her. He decides to move to Australia, where Little Em'ly can start a new life, as does the Micawber family. Steerforth dies in a storm just outside of Yarmouth, and Ham dies trying to rescue him. David moves away to recover from all that he has been through. During this time, he discovers that he truly loves Agnes. Not long after he returns to London, the two get married and live happily with three children as well as Miss Betsey, Peggotty, and Mr. Dick."
Heart of Darkness,"A group of men are aboard an English ship that is sitting on the Thames. The group includes a Lawyer, an Accountant, a Company Director/Captain, and a man without a specific profession who is named Marlow. The narrator appears to be another unnamed guest on the ship. While they are loitering about, waiting for the wind to pick up so that they might resume their voyage, Marlow begins to speak about London and Europe as some of the darkest places on earth. The narrator and other guests do not seem to regard him with much respect. Marlow is a stationary man, very unusual for a seaman. The others do not understand him because he does not fit into a neat category in the same manner that the others do. He mentions colonization and says that carving the earth into prizes or pieces is not something to examine too closely because it is an atrocity. He then begins to narrate a personal experience in Africa, which led him to become a freshwater sailor and gave him a terrible glimpse of colonization. With the exception of two or three small paragraphs, the perspective shifts to Marlow, who becomes the main narrator for the rest of the novel. Marlow has always had a passion for travel and exploration. Maps are an obsession of his. Marlow decides he wants nothing more than to be the skipper of a steamship that travels up and down a river in Africa. His aunt has a connection in the Administration Department of a seafaring and exploration company that gathers ivory, and she manages to get Marlow an appointment. He replaces a captain who was killed in a skirmish with the natives. When Marlow arrives at the company office, the atmosphere is extremely dim and foreboding. He feels as if everyone is looking at him pityingly. The doctor who performs his physical asks if there is a history of insanity in Marlow's family. He tells Marlow that nothing could persuade him to join the Company down in the Congo. This puzzles Marlow, but he does not think much of it. The next day he embarks on a one-month journey to the primary Company station. The African shores that he observes look anything but welcoming. They are dark and rather desolate, in spite of the flurry of human activity around them. When he arrives, Marlow learns that a company member recently committed suicide. There are multitudes of chain-gang types, who all look at him with vacant expressions. A young boy approaches Marlow, looking very empty. Marlow can do nothing but offer him some ship biscuits. He is very relieved to leave the boy behind as he comes across a very well-dressed man who is the picture of respectability and elegance. They introduce themselves: he is the Chief Accountant of the Company. Marlow befriends this man and frequently spends time in his hut while the Accountant goes over the accounts. After ten days of observing the Chief Accountant's ill temper, Marlow departs for his 200-mile journey into the interior of the Congo, where he will work for a station run by a man named Kurtz. The journey is arduous. Marlow crosses many paths, sees deserted dwellings, and encounters black men working. Marlow never describes them as humans. Throughout the novel, the white characters refer to them in animalistic terms. Marlow finally arrives at a secondary station, where he meets the Manager, who for now will oversee his work. It is a strange meeting. The Manager smiles in a manner that is very discomfiting. The ship on which Marlow is supposed to set sail is broken. While they await the delivery of the rivets needed to fix it, Marlow spends his time on more mundane tasks. He frequently hears the name ""Kurtz"" around the station. Clearly everyone knows his future boss. It is rumored that he is ill. Soon the entire crew will depart for a trip to Kurtz's station. The Manager's uncle arrives with his own expedition. Marlow overhears them saying that they would like to see Kurtz and his assistant hanged so that their station could be eliminated as ivory competition. After a day of exploring, the expedition has lost all of their animals. Marlow sets out for Kurtz's station with the Pilgrims, the cannibal crew, and the Manager. About eight miles from their destination, they stop for the night. There is talk of an approaching attack. Rumor has it that Kurtz may have been killed in a previous one. Some of the pilgrims go ashore to investigate. The whirring sound of arrows is heard; an attack is underway. The Pilgrims shoot back from the ship with rifles. The helmsman of the ship is killed, as is a native ashore. Marlow supposes that Kurtz has perished in the inexplicable attack. This upsets him greatly. Over the course of his travels, he has greatly looked forward to meeting this man. Marlow shares Kurtz's background: an English education, a woman at home waiting for him. In spite of Marlow's disappointment, the ship presses onward. A little way down the river, the crew spot Kurtz's station, which they had supposed was lost. They meet a Russian man who resembles a harlequin. He says that Kurtz is alive but somewhat ill. The natives do not want Kurtz to leave because he has expanded their minds. Kurtz does not want to leave because he has essentially become part of the tribe. After talking for a while with the Russian, Marlow has a very clear picture of the man who has become his obsession. Finally, he has the chance to talk to Kurtz, who is ill and on his deathbed. The natives surround his hut until he tells them to leave. While on watch, Marlow dozes off and realizes that Kurtz is gone. He chases him and finds Kurtz in the forest. He does not want to leave the station because his plans have not been fully realized. Marlow manages to take him back to his bed. Kurtz entrusts Marlow with all of his old files and papers. Among these is a photograph of his sweetheart. The Russian escapes before the Manager and others can imprison him. The steamboat departs the next day. Kurtz dies onboard a few days later, Marlow having attended him until the end. Marlow returns to England, but the memory of his friend haunts him. He manages to find the woman from the picture, and he pays her a visit. She talks at length about his wonderful personal qualities and about how guilty she feels that she was not with him at the last. Marlow lies and says that her name was the last word spoken by Kurtz--the truth would be too dark to tell her."
Dracula,"Dracula is an epistolary novel, meaning that is composed from letters, journal and diary entries, telegrams, and newspaper clippings. Jonathan Harker, Mina Murray , and Dr. Seward write the largest contributions to the novelalthough the writings of Lucy Westenra and Abraham Van Helsing constitute some key parts of the book. The novel is meant to have a slightly journalistic feel, as it is a harrowing account supposedly written by the people who witnessed the book's events. A young Englishman named Jonathan Harker travels through Transylvania on a business trip. He is there to aid Count Dracula, a Transylvanian nobleman, in buying an English estate. His journey into the remote Eastern European landscape is fearsome, although initially he is charmed by the Count's generosity and intelligence. Gradually, he comes to realize that he is a prisoner in Dracula's castle, and that the Count is a demonic being who plans to prey on the teeming masses of London. Dracula leaves him to die at the hands of three female vampires, but Jonathan attempts a desperate escape. . . Meanwhile, in England, Jonathan's fiancee Mina visits her best friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy has recently been proposed to by three menArthur Holmwood, Dr. Seward, and Quincey Morris. She chooses Arthur to be her happy fiance. Mina and Lucy vacation together at Whitby, a quaint seaside town. While they are there, a Russian vessel is shipwrecked. A large dog leaps from the wreck and runs away. All of its crew are missing save one dead captain. The ship was carrying fifty boxes of earth from Dracula's castle. Despite the wreck, the boxes are delivered as ordered. Lucy begins to exhibit strange behavior: she sleepwalks often, and she seems to be growing paler and weaker. Eerie things happenone night, Mina finds her unconscious in the cemetery, as a figure with glowing eyes bends over her. The figure disappears as Mina comes closer, but night after night strange events continue and Lucy grows thinner and paler with each passing day. Word comes from Budapest that Jonathan has been found, sick with brain fever. He can remember nothing of his travels in Transylvania. Mina goes to nurse him back to health and to help him make the trip back to England. When she arrives, they marry immediately. He gives her his diary but is afraid to read it; she seals the diary and promises that she will never read it unless it is for his sake. Back in England, Lucy has returned to her home in London. Arthur, fearful for her health, asks Dr. Seward to try to figure out what is wrong with her. Seward is baffled by her illness, and calls in the aid of his old mentor, the brilliant Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing seems to know from the beginning what he might be up against. He tries to use various charms, as well as constant blood transfusions, to keep Lucy alive. Again and again, his attempts are thwarted by a mixture of Dracula's cunning and bad luck. Lucy's mother is killed by a heart attack during one of Dracula's more dramatic plots to get to Lucy, and Lucy dies a few days later. Arthur's father dies at about this time. Van Helsing takes possession of Lucy's diary and correspondence, which lead him to make contact with Mina Harker. Meanwhile, the Harkers have returned to England. Peter Hawkins, Jonathan's boss, dies suddenlyleaving the Harkers a considerable fortune. One day while they are in London, Jonathan actually sees the Countwho has been restored to his youth by his feedingand although Jonathan cannot really remember things clearly, he has a nervous attack and falls unconscious. When he comes to, he cannot remember what upset him. Disturbed by this behavior, Mina decides to read the journal. The contents of the journal baffle her, and she wonders if her husband was already in the throes of brain fever. When Van Helsing comes to visit her to ask questions about Lucy, Mina is so impressed by the man that she gives him Jonathan's journal. It provides the missing link for Van Helsing, who now knows how the vampire came to England. Mysterious attacks against children have begun in the area where Lucy was buried. Van Helsing shows Seward, Quincey, and Arthur that the cause is Lucy, who is now one of the undead. Arthur is the one who gives his fiancee peace by staking her through the heart. The four men pledge to destroy Dracula next. Mina and Jonathan join with the men, and using the asylum of Dr. Seward as their headquarters, they plan to destroy Dracula for good. The fifty boxes, now scattered in and around London, are the key. The boxes are full of earth made sacred by Dracula's family, and he cannot survive unless he sleeps in them for at least part of the day. The men begin to hunt down the boxes' whereabouts. But Renfield, one of Dr. Seward's patients, works as Dracula's henchman, and with his aid the vampire is able to feed on Mina in secret. By the time the men learn what is going on, they are too late: they burst into the room one night to find Jonathan unconscious and Mina being forced to drink blood from Dracula's chest. Now, after enough time has passed she will become one of the undeadunless they can destroy Dracula first. They set to work, sterilizing all but one of the boxes in one day. Dracula, in the last box, flees back to Transylvania to rest and regroup for another attack. The band of friends tracks him down, splitting up so that Van Helsing and Mina will go to purge the castle while the four young men track the last box. Van Helsing and Mina succeed, killing the three female vampires and using holy wafer to render the castle uninhabitable for the undead. They then regroup with the others, and all together they surround the gypsies who are transporting Dracula in his coffin. During the struggle against the gypsies, Quincey receives a mortal wound. Jonathan and Quincey deliver the killing blows to Dracula just as the sun is setting."
A Hero of Our Time,"A Hero of Our Time is a novel, but can be more aptly described as a Preface, five short stories, and a Foreword placed between the second and third short stories. The five short stories center on Pechorin, a young Russian officer serving in the Caucasus. Below are quick summaries of each of the sections in the novel. Preface Lermontov, the novel's author, describes his reasoning for creating the Preface. He states that the current population needs messages to be spelled out for it. He denies the claim that he portrayed himself through Pechorin. He mocks critics who are horrified by Pechorin and the contents of the novel. He tells them that they have been exposed to far worse literary characters. Bela This short story is a frame narrative. An unnamed narrator, who is traveling through the Caucasus Mountains, encounters Maxim Maximych, an old officer. They converse and travel through the mountains together. When they seek shelter due to a blizzard, the old officer tells the unnamed narrator a story about a young officer, Pechorin. The unnamed narrator listens intently. In Maxim Maximych's story, Pechorin is enamored with a native girl named Bela. He barters with Bela's younger brother, Azamat. He promises to help Azamat steal a local tribesman's horse in return for Bela. In the end, both men obtain what they desire. Azamat gets his horse and runs far away with it while Pechorin gets Bela. At first, Bela rejects Pechorin, but then she soon falls for him. Their happiness, however, does not last long. The horse's owner, Kazbich, seeks revenge for his stolen horse. Since he is unable to punish Azamat, he kills Bela's father, and then mortally wounds Bela. Bela dies two days after her injuries are obtained. Pechorin is transferred elsewhere soon after. The story ends here. In the present time, Maxim Maximych's baggage slows his cart down. He is unable to keep up with the unnamed narrator's ride. They decide to separate, not expecting to meet each other again. Maxim Maximych This short story picks up where the first story ends. The unnamed narrator and Maxim Maximych are reunited. Maxim Maximych's baggage had not slowed him down too much. The two characters are happy to see each other again, but they encounter a rude servant at the place in which they are lodging. After a few questions, Maxim Maximych discovers that the servant's master is Pechorin. The old officer is overwhelmed with joy due to this discovery. He tells the servant to pass his name along to Pechorin. The servant grudgingly agrees to the request. Maxim Maximych waits for Pechorin, but Pechorin does not come. The next day, the unnamed narrator encounters Pechorin. He sends someone to fetch Maxim Maximych and urges Pechorin to wait. Maxim Maximych is disappointed with his reunification with Pechorin. Pechorin refuses to dine with him and refuses to take back his personal documents. Maxim Maximych had held on to the documents when Pechorin had left them behind, thinking that they meant something to Pechorin. Maxim Maximych throws the documents on the floor after Pechorin leaves him in the dust. The unnamed narrator picks up the journals, and he and Maxim Maximych part again the next day, this time for good. Foreword The unnamed narrator informs the reader that Pechorin is dead and alludes to the fact that the next few stories are taken directly from Pechorin's journal. The unnamed narrator continues the Foreword by describing his reasoning for publishing these contents. He finds Pechorin to be an intelligent, introspective, and unusually honest individual and believes that contents from Pechorin's journal will benefit society. The unnamed narrator also states that only contents pertaining to Pechorin's stay in the Caucasus will be published. Certain reasons, which he does not reveal, stop him from disclosing information outside of Pechorin's adventures in the Caucasus. Taman This is the first story in the novel told through Pechorin's perspective. Pechorin has a short stay in the coastal town, Taman. He is unable to find lodgings and resigns to staying in a small hut on the very edge of the sea. Upon requesting to speak to the master of the house, a blind boy creeps out of the darkness and informs him that the old woman who owns the hut and the shack beside it has gone to the village, and she is not currently available. Pechorin stays in the hut, but he cannot sleep. He sees a shadow pass by his window and follows it. It is the blind boy making his way to the beach. At the beach, Pechorin witnesses what seems to be a smuggling enterprise involving the blind boy, a young woman, and a man named Yanko. The next morning, he confronts the blind boy and the old woman, who has returned from the village. They him give no answers. He encounters the young woman after he leaves the old woman and the boy. After he questions her and gets nowhere, he tells her that he will tell the authorities what he witnessed the night before. The young woman tells him to meet her in the middle of the night at the beach. He agrees to her request. He goes to the beach and gets on a boat with her. They go far out onto the sea. There, she kisses him and attempts to drown him. Pechorin escapes by throwing her overboard. On his way back to the hut, Pechorin sees the young woman, but she does not see him. She survived the sea. Pechorin decides to spy on the young woman. He witnesses her escaping with Yanko. They leave behind the blind boy and the old woman. Pechorin leaves Taman the next morning. He does not alert the authorities to the events that transpired for fear of being ridiculed. Princess Mary Shortly after arriving in Pyatigorsk, a spa town, Pechorin encounters an army acquaintance, Grushnitsky. Pechorin and Gushnitsky dislike each other, but they are cordial with each other. Grushnitsky shows interest in a young woman of noble birth, Princess Mary. The young woman is visiting Pyatigorsk with her mother, Princess Ligovskoy. Pechorin decides to entertain himself with the romance that he sees transpiring between Grushnitsky and Princess Mary. He knows that Princess Mary will soon grow tired of Grushnitsky. Pechorin eventually decides to seduce Princess Mary for three main reasons: to satisfy his vanities, to destroy Grushnitsky's happiness, and to communicate with Vera, a lost love and a member of Princess Mary's inner circle, without arousing suspicions. He succeeds in winning Princess Mary's heart, even though he has no romantic feelings towards her. Grushnitsky retaliates against Pechorin for this betrayal with the help of a dragoon captain who Pechorin had infuriated in an early part of the story. Grushnitsky and Pechorin fight a duel. Pechorin kills Grushnitsky. In the end, no one receives a happy ending, not even Pechorin who has outwitted everyone. He loses Vera. The Fatalist Pechorin's last adventure takes place in a Cossack village. Pechorin and some of his army peers have a conversation on predestination. Pechorin's peers are divided on the issue. Some tell tales that support predestination, and others recount stories that disprove it. Vulich, an old officer and a known gambler, claims he has a way to solve the question. He gambles with his life to prove that predestination exists. He holds a gun to his head and shoots. The gun misfires. The other officers assume that the gun was not loaded. Vulich aims the gun again, this time at a wall. The gun fires a bullet into the wall. Everyone is intrigued, and Vulich collects his gold coins from Pechorin, who had betted against him. Half an hour after this incident, Vulich dies. A drunk Cossack slices him in half. Pechorin learns about Vulich's death when he is summoned to help apprehend the murderer, who has barricaded himself in a cottage. Pechorin risks his life to apprehend the Cossack. He succeeds with just a slight graze from a bullet. The last scene of the story involves a conversation between Pechorin and Maximych. Pechorin recounts his experiences in the Cossack village and tries to have a conversation with Maxim Maximych. The old general offers no real discourse -- he is not good at ""metaphysical discussions"" ."
The Phantom of the Opera,"There are rumors that the opera house is haunted by a phantom who makes himself known by sending letters to the managers and by causing disturbances. On the retirement gala for the old opera managers, opera singer Christine attracts the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Raoul. One night during a performance of Faust, with the resident prima donna, Carlotta, playing the female lead, the Phantom causes Carlotta to lose her voice and the chandelier to fall into the audience. Christine is kidnapped by the masked phantom; he tells her his name is Erik and reveals her love for her. When Christine unmasks the phantom out of curiosity, his ugliness shocks her. The phantom decides to keep Christine prisoner for the rest of her life, but then he allows her to leave after she promises to wear his ring and remain faithful to him. Christine later tells Raoul that she was kidnapped; Raoul promises to run away with her, both unaware that Erik has been listening to their conversation. During a production of Faust, Erik kidnaps Christine again and gives her an ultimatum: marry him or he will blow up the entire opera house. Christine refuses, but then she finds out that Erik has kidnapped Raoul as well as the Persian and has trapped them inside a torture chamber. In order to save them, as well as the occupants of the opera house, Christine agrees to marry Erik."
Leviathan,"Hobbes' Leviathan is divided into four parts: 1) of man, 2) of commonwealth, 3) of a Christian commonwealth, and 4) of the Kingdom of Darkness. His overall project is to explain by what reasons a commonwealth may govern men, and then to establish the best possible way for this government to function in order to accommodate the desires of its denizens. Part One begins naturally with man, for Hobbes believes that the commonwealth is nothing but an ""artificial man."" Beginning his argument at the most basic level, he argues that man exists in the external world as a reactive creature that senses objects and is driven to act by the constant motions of the world. These constant motions lead to man's constant and insatiable desires and wants, which in a state of nature pits everyone against another in a perpetual state of war. Here men are equal in that anyone can kill anyone else, and as such men live in a constant state of fear an anxiety. Since man's main goal in life is to protect his own life through his rational capacities he reasons that the best way to do this is to establish a state with a power great enough to protect all who consent to live under it. Thus, a state or commonwealth is established with the sole purpose of protecting the lives of those who live within it. Part Two is devoted to explaining the citizen's obligations to this state, or 'Leviathan', and its proper form and functions. According to Hobbes, the best form of government is a monarchy, since in any other form of government the sovereign power is not strong enough to protect the subjects from outside invaders and from themselves. A subject's duty to the sovereign is total, and acting otherwise is only hurting oneself, since the commonwealth is established for the self-preservation of its subjects. Of course one has the option of leaving the commonwealth if one finds it too oppressive, but to leave the commonwealth is to re-enter the state of war that characterizes pre-social man. This is the worst possible outcome, since here there is no right or wrong, no justice or injustice, and man is constantly defending himself. Part Three answers the question: is obedience to a sovereign authority consistent with obedience to a divine authority? Hobbes reasons that there is no conflict between obeying civil and divine laws, but that men are often led to in such a conflict through the false claim that God is present in the world as it exists. According to Hobbes, the Kingdom of God exists wholly outside the natural world, despite the frequent claims that a group has special access to the divine. Because God is totally supernatural, then, and because no person can claim to have communication with or to be a representative of God, members of the commonwealth cannot possibly subscribe to a religious authority. The only power that exists for man, Hobbes claims, is sovereign power. There is no religious power manifest on earth that is greater. In careful interpretation of scripture, Hobbes claims that there is no eternal soul that is punished or rewarded eternally in hell or heaven, and that there are no incorporeal spirits interacting with this world. In fact, he concludes, all that is necessary for proper worship of God is to obey civil laws in his absence, and to maintain faith in Him. Lastly, in Part four Hobbes paints a stark picture of what human life is like when not lived according to the principles he has set forth. He calls this benighted social state the Kingdom of Darkness, which is not 'hell' as conceived in religious dogma, but which is instead life of ceaseless manipulation by others. Hobbes argues that the main causes of ""spiritual darkness"" are the belief in the presence of the Kingdom of God on earth, and the philosophical and historical doctrines that perpetuate this falsehood. In particular, Hobbes attacks Aristotle's philosophy of essentialism for giving credence to the belief in eternal souls and immaterial spirits, as well as many tenets of Catholicism, especially the papacy."
The Goose Girl,"Meet Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, a princess from the mysterious land of Kildenree, who'd rather hang out with her horse or a bunch of birds than real humans. Why is this you ask? Because she can speak to them, of course. Ani has the gift of animal-speaking, which might sound exciting to you or me, but is a little mysterious to the people in her kingdom, who would much rather she have the gift of people-speaking like her mom . When Ani's dad suddenly dies from falling off his horse while riding with her one day, the queen sends Ani off to Bayern, the neighboring country, to be the princess bride for their prince. At first Ani's a little peeved, but then she decides to make the most of it. On the journey to Bayern though, her maid in waiting and guards have different ideas. Sure, Talone and a couple others are trustworthy, but her bestie-turned-enemy--Selia--turns Ungolad, Terne, and the rest of the guards against her. They steal her fancy clothes, crown, and identity, and kill anyone who stands in their way. Threatened, Ani runs away and hides in the woods, asking the animals where to go next. Eventually Ani finds a cabin and gets some help from Gilsa, the woman inside, and her son, Finn. She doesn't tell them who she really is, but they help her get back on her feet and take her to the Bayern kingdom anyway. The plan? Ani will go to the king and tell him who she really is and what Selia did, but when she gets there, she sees Selia hanging out with the Bayern girls, and she flips out. Who will believe that she is the princess over a people-speaker like Selia? Instead Ani takes a job as a goose girl since she can speak with animals and all. Ani settles into her life as a goose girl, learning what their honks and yips mean to one another. Conrad, the goose boy, finds her a bit weird, but she makes friends with Enna and Razo who also work in the palace--she tells them crazy stories about talking with the wind and horses that eat gold, and they think she's cool. One day she meets a palace guard named Geric and strikes up a friendship with him; he thinks she's funny . Before long, the two of them are major crushing on one another. Sounds perfect, right? Until Geric randomly dumps her by sending her a note that he can't love her. Um, okay. Even though Ani misses the finer things of life like warm baths and soft beds, she's pretty happy just being a goose girl, until she hears that Bayern is going to war with her home country Kildenree. Why? Selia's convinced the king that Kildenree is planning an attack of their own, but really, she just wants to make sure no one calls her bluff on her little identity theft. Now Ani knows she has to do something--it's no longer just about her anymore; her family could die because of this secret. First Ani gets her friends--Enna, Razo, and Conrad--to help her storm the palace and tell the king the truth about whom she really is. Of course, Selia denies the whole thing, but Geric figures out a clever way of eavesdropping on the wannabe princess. Busted. Once Selia is found out and captured, Ani gets back to the palace, where she uncovers a bit of very good news: Geric isn't a palace guard; he's Prince Charming looking for a bride. Now that he's available and Ani's the princess, the two can get hitched and live happily ever after."
Main Street,"An intelligent, beautiful young woman named Carol Milford finishes college with dreams of changing the world. She starts work as a librarian before marrying a rural doctor named Will Kennicott. She moves to his hometown of Gopher Prairie with visions of transforming the town into a rural utopia... but she's only there for one day before she realizes she might have made a huge mistake. Carol tries her best to express her progressive political views and to get the people of Gopher Prairie to care about culture. She asks the folks of the town why they don't treat the farmers and laborers better, but nobody wants to hear about her kooky ""socialist"" ideas. Then Carol tries to start a drama club so that she can put on classy plays for the town. But--surprise, surprise--the people in the club end up picking a lame play, and they totally butcher it with horrible acting. Now you might think that would be bad enough, but the worst part is that everyone in the town thinks that the play is a huge success. That's when Carol truly realizes that her efforts are for nothing. When she gets fed up with the phony middle-class people of Gopher Prairie, Carol turns to Miles Bjornstam for companionship. Miles is the town crank--he's a man who believes in workers' rights. Carol feels like he's the only person she can be real with, but even Miles settles down once he gets married to Carol's maid, Bea Sorenson. Miles curbs his radical opinions so that his wife and son won't get bullied. In time, Miles's wife and son die from typhoid fever, and Miles leaves Gopher Prairie feeling heartbroken. When he leaves, Carol feels like she's losing her only outlet for her deepest feelings. With Miles gone, Carol tries as hard as she can to love Gopher Prairie and her husband Will. At first, the strategy actually works, but soon enough, Carol can feel her dissatisfaction coming back. She's just not ready to settle down into the boring mediocrity of Gopher Prairie. The problem is that Gopher Prairie isn't ready to change, so she's found herself a standstill. When she no longer feels love for her husband, Carol tries to find an outlet for her dissatisfaction by striking up a romantic relationship with a young tailor's assistant named Erik Valbourg. Erik has big dreams, just like Carol. But Carol's husband Will finds out about the affair, and Erik leaves Gopher Prairie in disgrace. After the fact, Carol is devastated to realize that Erik doesn't have the talent to fulfill any of his big dreams. She can't help but think the same is true for her. Worse yet, Carol learns that her frenemy Vida Sherwin has secretly been accomplishing the things she wants--like building a new school in the town--behind Carol's back. The truth is that things can change in Gopher Prairie--but they won't change just because Carol wants them do. To save her marriage, Carol takes a trip to California with her husband Will. But the trip can't change the fact that they are two different people with very different priorities. Carol eventually gets so fed up with Gopher Prairie that she takes her son Hugh and leaves her husband Will to go live and work in Washington, D.C. She finally feels as though she's making a life for herself, but after two years, she realizes that she has exhausted almost all her possibilities in D.C. Carol travels back to Gopher Prairie to be with her husband again. She's still not satisfied, and her only hope is that the world will provide better opportunities for her daughter."
The Canterville Ghost,"Horace B. Otis is a rather self-righteous American minister with a brusque personality easily confused with rudeness. Shrugging off the warnings of his British friends, he has purchased Canterville Chase, an English manor with a long history of accounts of ghosts and hauntings. Otis refuses to be cowed by threats that he is buying a haunted mansion. Otis, after all, does not believe that ghosts actually exist. Soon after the Otis family moves into the Tudor castle, Horace's wife Lucretia discovers a bloodstain in a sitting room. Upset, she orders that the stain be cleaned away upon the nonce. The housekeeper of Canterville Chase, Mrs. Umney, is thereby forced to explain to Mrs. Otis that the stain has been there since 1575 and is the result of Lady Eleanore de Canterville being brutally murdered by her husband, one Sir Simon de Canterville. In other words, any orders to have the stained cleaned away will produce the same result: the blood stays where it is. Americans will be Americans and Washington Otis, the eldest son of Horace, quickly declares his faith in the Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent by attempting to prove Mrs. Umney not only wrong, but a fool. As he scrubs and scrubs at the bloodstain, thunder and lightning punctuate the unexpected disappearance of the stain. That disappearance prompts Mrs. Umney to faint. The Americans have proven their ability to conquer long-lasting British myths. Until the next day when the stain shows up in the same place again. Out comes Pinkerton's Stain Remover and away goes the stain. Day and day and day the stain is removed only to reappear. Finally, the Otis family begins to suspect that just perhaps there is something to the stories of Canterville Chase being haunted, after all. This belief really starts to kick in when Horace wakes up to a very weird sound. A clanking, metallic sound. Rushing to the hallway, Mr. Otis runs full into a shocking sight: a ghost with eyes as red as the fires of hell, thickly matted hair and heavy chains around his limbs. Where his British friends might have run in fear from this sight, the far more pragmatic American takes a considerably different perspective: he suggest that the ghost might just benefit from the application of Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator. As if this reaction is not enough of an insult to a ghost who has been successfully scaring off interlopers inside his ancestral manse for centuries, the ghost is nearly injured by pillows aimed at his head by the two youngest members of the Otis clan, twins nicknamed Stars and Stripes. Scared off by the boorish behavior of the rude Americans, the Canterville Ghost takes leave to contemplate former glories in which he scared a successive number of buyers through a varied array of ghost personae. While the rest of the Otis clan are busy analyzing why the shade of red of the bloodstain seems to change, 15 year old Virginia seems particularly pensive over the state of the stain. As their stay continues, the twins continue their attempts to torture the ghost and when he calls upon his particularly horrific laugh as the ultimate means of instilling terror and dread, the ghost is only greeted with advice from Mrs. Otis on the potential for Dr. Dobell's tincture as a cure for the indigestion that must surely be the cause of a such a sound. And so things continue: the ghosts tries to scare the Otis family and the Otis family refuses to join the lineage of proper British citizenry that responded in the normal fashion. Things hit rock bottom for the Canterville Ghost when Stars and Stripes actually create a fake ghost of their own to scare the real ghost. One last go at the Americans in his guise as Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl only results in further humiliation which causes Sir Simon to pretty much give up on ever living the dream of putting the fear of god into the latest owners of Canterville Chase. Meanwhile, the Duke of Cheshire shows up one day to take advantage of his position as guest to further pine over the love of his life: the rather prudish but beautiful Virginia. It is while taking a ride with the Duke that Virginia happens to come upon the secret hiding lair of the ghost of Canterville Chase. Virginia tries to warn the ghost not to try any scary stuff, but the ghost convinces here that acts of haunting are pretty much the entire reason for ghosts to exist. Take away their ability to put a scare into the living and what purpose does a ghost even have? Virginia takes pity on the ghost and even though she finds it beyond forgiveness that Sir Simon has been using her paints to color in the bloodstain every morning, she agrees to assist him from his pitiable state. After refusing her offer to help him make his way to America, she takes his hand and disappears with him into another dimension. The lovesick Duke returns from his school to help the family find his cherished Virginia upon learning of her mysterious disappearance. Finally, as the clock strikes the last of the midnight chords, all of Canterville Chase shakes under the yoke of some uncanny force and the presence of Virginia appears in the dark at the top of the stairs. Her only explanation of her disappearance is that she has assisted in finally bringing eternal rest to the Canterville Ghost. As a token of his thanks and affection, Sir Simon has given her a box filled with jewels. Virginia leads the family into the secret lair of the ghost where they are greeted by the sight of his skeletal remains. Four days later, Sir Simon's body is finally laid to rest with a proper burial. Years later, Virginia has softened toward the Duke and agreed to his proposal of marriage. Long after the ceremony, she still steadfastly refuses the address the queries he poses about what exactly happened during the period of her disappearance. All she is willing to offer is that what she knows about the true meaning of Life, Death, and Love she owes entirely to the lessons taught her by the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville."
Villette,"Lucy Snowe, a young Englishwoman of the educated class, narrates the story of her life--in a particularly partisan and sometimes unreliable manner. She is left destitute after the death of her mysterious family and, after briefly being a nurse-companion, takes herself off on a blind, daring trip to the Continent. She goes to the kingdom of Labassecour and, through a series of very fortunate occurrences, manages to land herself a job and a place to live on her first night in the town of Villette. She becomes a nursery governess to the three daughters of the proprietress of a large school for girls. During her time as the bonne d'enfants, she impresses her employer, Madame Beck, with her modesty and excellent English. She is elevated to the position of English teacher, though she has no qualifications for it and has a poor command of the French language spoken in Villette. Lucy, however, comes to excel at teaching and to love it. Dr. John Graham Bretton, a friend of Lucy's in her childhood, also happens to be working in Villette. Their paths cross, but he does not recognize her. During this time Lucy and a student at Madame Beck's, Ginevra Fanshawe, become friends, and Lucy learns of Ginevra's secret suitors. One of them is Dr. John, for whom Lucy has also formed an attachment. Ginevra is fickle and selfish, and Lucy cannot understand how Ginevra could prefer another to her adored Dr. John. Meanwhile, the imperious and difficult M. Paul, a professor of literature, is paying Lucy attention, but chiefly to admonish her and instruct her about what he considers proper conduct for a young lady. Two more friends from Lucy's childhood, Paulina Home and her father, now live in Villette. Mr. Home has inherited a title and a fortune, and he and his daughter live in fine style. Paulina , who is younger than both Dr. John and Lucy, stayed with the Brettons when a young child and formed an interestingly adult attachment to Dr. John. Dr. John, who was enamored of Polly's flighty cousin Ginevra, now transfers his affections to the seventeen-year-old. During this time Lucy is visited by a spectral nun, said to the be the shade of a sister buried alive in the garden when Madame Beck's school was a convent. Lucy learns that M. Paul, with whom she has had several battles but has formed a friendship, was engaged to be married twenty years ago to a woman named Justine Marie. Because of debts and the unforeseen death of M. Paul's father, the two were unable to marry, and she died very young in a convent. M. Paul supports Justine's family in a house with a priest named Pere Silas. Lucy also learns that M. Paul lives quietly in two rooms at a nearby boys' college, keeping no servants. Lucy and M. Paul become very good friends, and he calls her his sister. At one moment, however, Lucy thinks that perhaps M. Paul feels more strongly for her. He tries to convert her to Catholicism, but Lucy is a truly faithful believer in the Protestant faith of her upbringing, and becoming a Catholic for her is not possible. Though the two finally come to some agreement on the relative worth of their faiths, it is clear that Lucy's Protestantism will keep her from ever being M. Paul's wife. Pere Silas and Madame Beck counsel M. Paul that marriage to Lucy is an impossibility, and M. Paul decides he must go to Guadalupe to take care of some business interests of Madame Malravens. Dr. John and Polly fall in love. They exchange letters, hoping to become engaged. M. de Bassompierre is against letting his daughter go, but he eventually relents. The couple marry and are happy, having many healthy children. Ginevra, formerly loved by Dr. John, is now jealous and dislikes her cousin Polly. M. Paul and Lucy fall in love, but she is not a Catholic, and the decision has already been made for him to leave. Before he goes he is very mysterious and does not see Lucy until the night before his departure. He has procured a house for her to set up a new school so that she may be independent and wait for him to return from Guadalupe. They exchange pledges of love, and M. Paul leaves. Ginevra has been seeing the Count De Hamal secretly. He has been visiting her at the school dressed as the spectral nun. On the night Ginevra elopes with the Count, it is revealed to Lucy that the ghostly visitation was nothing other than Count De Hamal in disguise. Lucy is relieved that she has never seen a ghost. Lucy leaves the school and prospers at her own school while she waits for M. Paul's return. She receives an unexpected legacy from an old friend, with which she turns her day school into a boarding school. The ending of the novel is ambiguous, but it is implied that M. Paul dies in a shipwreck on his way home. Lucy lives out her life alone, at least comforted by the memory of love."
From the Earth to the Moon,"The Gun Club is bored. With the Civil War over, these illustrious cannon-makers have nothing to do with their time, and they're kind of freaking out. Luckily, President Barbicane--head of the club--comes to the rescue. He suggests that they build a giant cannon, so powerful that it can launch a shot straight to the moon. This news is met with wild celebrations from both the Gun Club and the public at large. But excitement is the easy part; now they have to figure out how to actually get it done. After speaking to experts at the Cambridge Observatory, the Gun Club decides to launch the shot the following December from a spot near the equator. That only gives them two options within the U.S.--Florida and Texas. After a fierce competition, Florida wins out. The Gun Club relocates to Tampa to begin production, and things are going swell. Out of the blue, Barbicane receives a telegram from a Frenchman named Michel Ardan who wants to take a ride inside their moon-bound cannonball. The kid's got guts, we'll give him that. After altering the design to meet Ardan's requests, Barbicane agrees and the wild celebrations start anew. This time, though, the party is cut short by a man named Captain Nicholl. Nicholl and Barbicane have been rivals since the Civil War, and Nicholl is fed up, so he challenges Barbicane to a duel. Luckily, Ardan arrives in the nick of time and averts the situation with an enticing counter-proposal: that the three of them travel to the moon together. With their plans finally set in stone, and December fast approaching, the Gun Club prepares for launch. The cannon fires successfully, but it inadvertently triggers a series of harsh weather patterns that make it impossible to track the capsule. When the sky finally clears up, they discover that the capsule has missed its mark--it's now orbiting the moon. And no one knows what will happen next... including us."
The Power and the Glory,"Our protagonist, an unnamed priest, has come to a river port in the hope of escaping a Mexican state government that wants him dead. All because he's a priest, which in this state is a crime of treason! He's the last one, so no pressure or anything. He doesn't get out. First because he passes the time drinking brandy with an English dentist named Mr. Tench, and second because he grudgingly decides to help a boy's dying mother. Meanwhile, the lieutenant, our not-so-friendly neighborhood antagonist, asks his chief for the authority to take hostages from the villages the priest visits and shoot them if the villagers don't turn in the traitor cleric. The chief digs it, and the plan is implemented. On the run again, the priest finds temporary shelter at the home of Captain Fellows and then in a village of people desperate to confess their sins and receive the Eucharist at Mass. He next seeks safety in the village of his daughter and her mother. In the early morning before dawn, the priest says Mass as reports come to him that the police are near and headed his way. When the lieutenant arrives, the villagers refuse to give the priest over to him, and he takes a hostage. After an awkward moment with his daughter, the priest departs and heads toward Carmen. On the way, an unwelcomed companion called the mestizo joins him. Sensing the man's coming betrayal, the priest tries several times to ditch him and finally succeeds. Now in the capital, the priest needs wine so he can continue to say Mass. An opportunity to obtain it turns bitter after the priest is arrested for carrying brandy. In prison he meets the mestizo, staying there as a guest, but the would-be traitor won't turn him in now knowing he'll get no reward. He's a crafty one, that's for sure. The priest is released from prison and given a little money by the lieutenant. The priest makes for the mountains and the border of the state. Though feverish, he escapes. Enjoying once again a life of comfort and relative luxury, the priest is none too pleased when the half-caste shows up again, claiming that a man has been shot and needs a priest before he dies. The priest's Spidey-sense detects the trap, but, believing himself duty-bound, he follows his own personal Judas. The man, an American criminal, is indeed dying, but refuses confession. The setting is indeed a trap, and the priest is finally caught. News that the last priest has been detained reaches the people who had helped him along his way: Captain Fellows and his wife, Mr. Tench, who's trying his best to relieve the chief of police's tooth ache and watches the execution from the window, and a mother who has been reading a prohibited religious book to her children. In the last scene of the novel, a new priest shows up. He'll have his own joys and sorrows no doubt."
Notes from the Underground,"The Underground Man, our first-person narrator, begins by telling us how hateful and unattractive he is. It seems he's been living ""underground"" for 20 years, unable to act in any way because he's so intelligent he can debunk any justification for doing so. Intelligent men, he says, can never become anything - and he himself is the case in point. The Underground Man reveals that he is 40 years old and living in St. Petersburg, Russia. He used to be a civil servant, but he inherited some money and retired, all the more time for discoursing on his life's many problems. Despite his surroundings of mire and filth, he sometimes experiences attacks of ""the sublime and beautiful,"" American Beauty-style moments where is taken by the awe-inspiring things of the world . His narration takes the form of a retort - he imagines his reader responding to his absurd claims, so he fills in our half of the conversation and then responds in turn. His first big argument concerns free will and the laws of nature. He chooses 2+2=4 to represent all the laws of reason, and asks how we can all be free if we have to accept 2+2=4, even if want it to equal five. A normal man, a man of action, will just accept it, but he, a man of hyper-consciousness, cannot. Next we move to the subject of suffering. Suffering, the Underground Man argues, is enjoyable, particularly when you're conscious of it. For instance, when he knows he's at rock bottom and has no chance of ever getting better, he takes pleasure in that. Intentional suffering, he later explains, has a lot to do with free will and the laws of nature that we've already mentioned. The Underground Man considers that we may someday figure out all the laws of nature, and then be able to predict what everyone will do, think, and want. Were this to happen, he predicts, man would just go mad to escape the determinism. If you tell man that he will act according to reason, that he will always pursue his best interests, he will consciously act against that just because he can. Man will cause destruction and chaos to prove that he has free will. The Underground Man uses this as a reason to reject the idea of a perfect socialist society referred to as ""Crystal Palace."" Free will doesn't allow it, and besides, he would resent a structure which he couldn't deride. He also argues that man loves building things, not having a finished product. We wouldn't be satisfied with perfection, because there would be nothing left to do. As Part I draws to a close, the Underground Man tells us that he will never have readers; his audience will always be imaginary. We move into Part II, which is made up of the Underground Man's reminiscences back to when he was 24 years old. Before the flashbacks start, however, he complains for a while about Romanticism. He dislikes silly, cloud-gazing romantics from France and Germany. To him, Russian romantics are a very different sort, capable of appreciating the sublime and beautiful, but still rooted in reality. He seems to fancy himself one of these Russian romantics, and often indulges in literary fantasies of the sublime and beautiful. Now onto his memories. The first story concerns an officer who greatly offended our narrator by...taking him by the shoulders and moving him out of the way one night in a tavern. The Underground Man harbors his spite for years and plots revenge, deciding to bump into the officer intentionally while walking along the Nevsky . The plotting and planning drags on, and when the bump finally goes down, the Underground Man gets the worst of it as the officer doesn't even notice. The next story  involves a going-away dinner for an alpha-male named Zverkov whom, big surprise, the Underground Man hates. The Underground man invites himself along to the dinner, thrown by several mutual friends, and makes an utter jerk of himself by insulting everyone many times over. The men leave him behind to continue their evening at a brothel, and the Underground Man follows shortly after. By the time he gets there, the men are gone. The Underground Man doesn't leave, though - instead, he sleeps with a prostitute named Liza. After they have sex, he lectures Liza on how she really shouldn't be a prostitute, as it's not good for her soul. She weeps; and he gives her his address. The Underground Man then goes home and, for a week or two, has a strained tiff with his servant Apollon, whom he also hates. One day, Liza shows up. They have an intense spat that ends with the Underground Man breaking down in tears. Liza comforts him, they have sex again, and then he goes back to being sullen and offensive, hinting for her to leave and stuffing money into her hand to insult her further. Liza peaces out but leaves the cash behind, which the Underground Man finds to be unexpectedly noble. He chases after her. It's too late; she's gone. And that's the end of his flashback."
On Liberty,"In the beginning, the retention of liberty was necessary to protect against political tyranny of overzealous rulers. Citizens began to realize that in order to achieve their absolute liberty, government would have to begin working as an instrument, a delegate of the people's will. Whatever the majority opinion was would have to be the decision made by the government so the citizenry would never feel as though their best interests weren't being served. However, Mill cites this so-called victory of the people is nothing of the sort, it simply paved the way for a new type of tyranny: the tyranny of prevailing opinion. This tyranny is even more evil, according to Mill because it is pervasive, penetrating the intricacies of life and social interaction and silencing the minority's voice. This mute portion of the community may have the wrong, right, or part of the truth in its opinion it doesn't matter according to Mill. No matter what they have to contribute, it is extremely helpful to the community. The majority opinion is often faulted because it is biased with self-interest and personal convictions. There is no way for the majority to know that they are right and they owe it to the whole of society to listen to all arguments because it is clear that human opinion is fallible. Because of this great possibility of errors in judgment and an individual's right to autonomy, Mill believes that society should not impose its values on anyone. A person should have the right to act as they wish as long as the negative consequences of such actions are only felt by that person. However, if a person's act is not self-regarding and adversely affects others, a person should be held accountable for that act. Mill thinks that individual autonomy is opposite to the instincts of society, he asserts that society encourages and rewards conformity. Mill thinks that society, highly liable to be influenced and wrong, should not serve as the impetus for the government's actions. Public opinion is a dangerous basis for the government to act upon because there are countless numbers of citizens who are not able to have their voices heard. The danger that lies in the government acting in response to the public opinion can be seen by looking at the past where actions that had the support of a consensus of the people are now deemed to be infringements upon human liberty. The truth, says Mill, does not always make itself apparent and we should not rely on an supposed eventual revelation of the truth to show us the best way to proceed. Mill refutes the claim that religion should play a role in determining the weight of an individual's opinion, stating that the greatest moral leaders often did not believe in Christianity, but their work was just as valuable. Following a religious doctrine, according to Mill, does not make a person morally sound, as an individual must strike a balance between religion, faith and their own personal morality. The very capricious nature of humanity seems to be something that Mill values highly. Mill believes that human desires are not to be suppressed and molded to fit a doctrine or societal ideal, but rather followed and explored. He decrees that anything that suppresses the ability of humans to be unique is tyrannical, whether it is a code of conduct or a religion. The original thought and spontaneity that people can have are immeasurably important for new discoveries and new truths. Geniuses are products of this spontaneous thought, they are not conformists, but those that have been allowed to wander with their ideas and explore the possibilities. Eccentricity, something that is often frowned upon by society, is the key to genius behavior. It is that departure from the normal that allows new perspectives to be seen and a happier society to exist. Mill does not absolve individuals completely from obligations to society, however. He does acknowledge that in exchange for the protection that society offers, individuals show have a modicum of respect for their fellow members of society. However, if they don't choose to do this, they are eligible to be punished either in legal or social circles. For those who injure society in ways that cannot be punished in a court of law, Mill says that society is more than welcome to use its opinions and judgment as punishment. It is the duty of society to warn others about a person who is harmful to others; coercion is allowed when it is meant to assist others in the retention of their liberty. If a member of society refuses to abide by self-regarding principles, then Mill asserts society cannot coerce that person to reform or coerce other society members to avoid that person. Society can hold individual negative opinions of a such a person and advise others of that person's faults. This is the only punishment inflicted on a person who does harmful things to themselves - the penalty of public opinion. Mill contends such a person is obviously already receiving punishment as a result of the action they have inflicted on themselves. Society is not exempt from its duty to the individual, either. Mill contends that society has the responsibility to develop its children into rational and moral human beings. If a society finds itself with a preponderance of incompetent, immoral citizens, then it only has itself to blame. After a person's developmental adolescence phase, however, society's responsibility to influence the individual stops and society has no right to tell the individual what are the correct decisions. Mill does some preemptive strikes on potential detractors from his work as well. To the assertion that noone's actions affect solely themselves, Mill agrees in part. However, he says that society only has the right to interfere when the effect of a person's actions brings a strong risk of or actual damage. If a person's actions have little significance to society, it is actually in society's best interest to preserve personal liberty rather than to obsess over an individual's action. Mill applies his principles to real life situations as well. He states that trading is a public act while consuming is not; therefore selling of certain products can be regulated more than the actual use of them. In competitive situations, Mill states that the harm principle should not be enforced at all times because when there is a winner, there will inevitably be a loser who is harmed. However, the winner should not be punished for winning and harming the losing party if all measures taken to win were indeed moral. As far as the practice of taxing goods that are harmful, Mill concedes that this is okay because it is better to tax nonessential goods than essential ones. Mill does not ascribe to the principle of complete self-ownership as some may suspect he would his idea of the importance of liberty supersedes individual rights in the case of a person who would want to sell himself into slavery. On the subject of education, Mill believes in universal education standards for all children and a parent's inherent duty to ensure that their child receives an excellent education. The basic underlying theme in Mill's work is the lack of trust that can be placed in the government. He cannot condone any measures that would give the government the power of prevention or undue influence over individual lives. He believes that adding any power to the structure of the government is a dangerous act and most of his ideas can be seen as extensions of his desire to make the government more of an advisory and organizational body. For Mill, the ideal government would be a central body that while respected, simply gives strong advisories to local officials who are committed to upholding the interests of their constituency and hearing all opinions expressed. Mill firmly believes that the strength and capability of a citizenry is linked to the success of a state and instead of exterminating the desires and abilities of its citizens, the government should not be afraid to cultivate a strong state with intelligent individuals who can make their own decisions."

The Scarlet Letter,"Hester is being led to the scaffold, where she is to be publicly shamed for having committed adultery. Hester is forced to wear the letter A on her gown at all times. She has stitched a large scarlet A onto her dress with gold thread, giving the letter an air of elegance. Hester carries Pearl, her daughter, with her. On the scaffold she is asked to reveal the name of Pearl's father, but she refuses. In the crowd Hester recognizes her husband from Amsterdam, Roger Chillingworth. Chillingworth visits Hester after she is returned to the prison. He tells her that he will find out who the man was, and he will read the truth on the man's heart. Chillingworth then forces her to promise never to reveal his true identity as her cuckolded husband. Hester moves into a cottage bordering the woods. She and Pearl live there in relative solitude. Hester earns her money by doing stitchwork for local dignitaries, but she often spends her time helping the poor and sick. Pearl grows up to be wild, even refusing to obey her mother. Roger Chillingworth earns a reputation as a good physician. He uses his reputation to get transferred into the same home as Arthur Dimmesdale, an ailing minister. Chillingworth eventually discovers that Dimmesdale is the true father of Pearl, at which point he spends every moment trying to torment the minister. One night Dimmesdale is so overcome with shame about hiding his secret that he walks to the scaffold where Hester was publicly humiliated. He stands on the scaffold and imagines the whole town watching him with a letter emblazoned on his chest. While standing there, Hester and Pearl arrive. He asks them to stand with him, which they do. Pearl then asks him to stand with her the next day at noon. When a meteor illuminates the three people standing on the scaffold, they see Roger Chillingworth watching them. Dimmesdale tells Hester that he is terrified of Chillingworth, who offers to take Dimmesdale home. Hester realizes that Chillingworth is slowly killing Dimmesdale and that she has to help Dimmesdale. A few weeks later, Hester sees Chillingworth picking herbs in the woods. She tells him that she is going to reveal the fact that he is her husband to Dimmesdale. He tells her that Providence is now in charge of their fates, and she may do as she sees fit. Hester takes Pearl into the woods, where they wait for Dimmesdale to arrive. He is surprised to see them, but he confesses to Hester that he is desperate for a friend who knows his secret. She comforts him and tells him Chillingworth's true identity. He is furious but finally agrees that they should run away together. He returns to town with more energy than he has ever shown before. Hester finds a ship that will carry all three of them, and it works out that the ship is due to sail the day after Dimmesdale gives his Election Sermon. But on the day of the sermon, Chillingworth persuades the ship's captain to take him on board as well. Hester does not know how to get out of this dilemma. Dimmesdale gives his Election Sermon, and it receives the highest accolades of any preaching he has ever performed. He then unexpectedly walks to the scaffold and stands on it, in full view of the gathered masses. Dimmesdale calls Hester and Pearl to come to him. Chillingworth tries to stop him, but Dimmesdale laughs and tells him that he cannot win. Hester and Pearl join Dimmesdale on the scaffold. Dimmesdale then tells the people that he is also a sinner like Hester, and that he should have assumed his rightful place by her side over seven years earlier. He then rips open his shirt to reveal a scarlet letter on his flesh. Dimmesdale falls to his knees and dies on the scaffold. Hester and Pearl leave the town for a while, and several years later Hester returns. No one hears from Pearl again, but it is assumed that she has gotten married and has had children in Europe. Hester never removes her scarlet letter, and when she passes away she is buried in the site of King's Chapel."
Babbitt,"George F. Babbitt is a 46-year-old American real estate salesman living in the Midwestern city of Zenith. He is successful, having a thriving business, a wife and three children, a very nice house and car, and all the modern conveniences. But Babbitt is profoundly dissatisfied. His family irritates him, and he generally has the sense that his life is empty. He consistently dreams of a young fairy girl with whom he is happy and free, and he notices every pretty woman he sees. He plans a trip to Maine with his closest friend, Paul Riesling - who is also dissatisfied with his marriage and career - in order to escape from his wife, Myra, and his three children . Although he finds the trip refreshing, he reverts to his former habits and uneasiness shortly after returning to Zenith. Although he has always been an upstanding and moral citizen, Babbitt desires to break with social convention and marital fidelity. Babbitt's devastation, then, after Paul goes to jail for murdering his wife Zilla, motivates him to change his life drastically. When Babbitt meets Tanis Judique, an interesting and attractive widow, he begins an affair with her and becomes entangled in her group of bohemian friends. He goes out every night while Myra is away, drinking and dancing until dawn and reveling in his freedom. With the influence of the progressive Seneca Doane, he also frightens and disappoints all of his conservative friends at the Boosters' club by supporting liberal politics and labor union strikes. When he is invited by Vergil Gunch to join the Good Citizens' League and to bring down men like Seneca Doane, Babbitt refuses. Yet, Babbitt becomes even unhappier when his former associates begin to ignore him and his business begins to suffer on account of his politics and his infidelity. Even his relationship with Tanis loses its appeal when she becomes emotionally demanding. He severs the extramarital relationship and longs to rejoin the ranks of solid, standard citizens. When Myra falls ill with appendicitis, he has both the motivation and the excuse to renounce his uncharacteristically immoral behavior and to return to his more familiar and comfortable lifestyle. He joins the Good Citizens' League, repairs damaged business relationships, shows greater affection for his wife, and renews his membership in the Church. Still, Babbitt's brief rebellion does slightly change his view of the world. When Ted elopes with Eunice Littlefield and announces that he does not want to complete his college degree, Babbitt urges him to pursue his ideals without fearing what others will think of him."

They walk around for hours, until fortunately discovering Badger's front door. Chapter 4 - ""Mr. Badger"" Badger invites them into his home, where they rest for a few days. During their visit, Badger tells them his plan to confront Toad over his driving habit, which has become reckless and expensive. Chapter 5 - ""Dulce Domum"" Mid-December, Rat and Mole are traveling home from an adventure when Mole senses that his old home is nearby. He and Badger spend an evening there, during which time Mole realizes he still loves the place, but prefers to live out in nature with Rat. Chapter 6 - ""Mr. Toad"" Later in the spring, Badger asks Mole and Rat to help him confront Toad about his dangerous automobile habits. At Toad Hall, Badger tries to speak maturely to Toad, but Toad remains childish and refuses to listen. Thus, they place him on house arrest, guarding him one at a time. Unfortunately, Toad is very cunning and manipulative, and he is able to escape by fooling Rat. He runs to a nearby inn, where he sees an automobile. Unable to help himself, he steals the car and wrecks it. Consequently, he is arrested and sentenced to twenty years in jail. Chapter 7 - ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" Chapter 7 is a tangent from Toad's story. When Rat and Mole learn that Otter's son Portly has been missing, they set out on the river to search for him. It is a beautiful night, and they soon hear some strange singing. On an island, they find Portly with a strange deity who resembles the Greek god Pan. He sings them a song, which they love but immediately forget. They return Portly to Otter, and reflect on the marvelous experience. Chapter 8 - ""Toad's Adventures"" Meanwhile, the gaoler's daughter takes pity on the forlorn Toad in prison, and she helps rig an escape for him. He switches clothes with the jail's washerwoman, and uses it to flee. However, he forgets to grab his wallet, so is unable to buy a train ticket. Luckily, he convinces the engine driver to take him. When the police soon start to pursue the train, Toad jumps off and has to resort to walking. Chapter 9 - ""Wayfarers All"" Later in the summer, Rat becomes restless, wondering why so many people leave the river bank for winter. When he meets a sailor named Sea Rat, he almost sets out at sea himself, but is saved from such folly by Mole. Chapter 10 - ""The Further Adventures of Toad"" Toad comes across a bargewoman, and tricks her into giving him a ride down river. When she discovers Toad is not a real washerwoman, though, she kicks him off the barge. He then steals her horse and finds his way to a peddler. There, he attempts to swindle the peddler by selling the horse for over its value. He soon enough hitchhikes, and is picked up by the same automobile he had previously stolen. Still dressed as a washerwoman, he convinces the driver to let him drive, and soon wrecks the vehicle again. Fleeing, he falls into the river and is carried with the current until Rat luckily fishes him out of the water downstream. Chapter 11 - ""Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears"" Toad soon learns from his friends that the weasels and stoats have taken over Toad Hall. Under Badger's leadership, the four main characters develop a plan to sneak into Toad Hall through a secret passageway and surprise the weasels during a party. Chapter 12 - ""The Return of Ulysses"" The plan is a great success; they chase the squatters away, and immediately start planning for a party. Still arrogant, Toad plans to sing and speak about his great adventures, but Badger refuses to allow it. Influenced by Badger's stoic nature, Toad shifts his personality, and acts like an adult at the party. The characters enjoy the party, and live out their days peacefully along the riverside."
Madame Bovary,"Charles Bovary is a pretty dull guy. He has an average career, no ambition, and has already been through an unhappy marriage of convenience to a harpy-like widow. With wife # 1 out of the way, however, he's free to marry again - and soon enough, he finds a gorgeous, exciting girl named Emma Rouault.Emma, a convent-educated farm girl with a head full of romantic fantasies and ideals, is willing to do anything to get off her father's farm, so she and Charles end up married in short order. The couple moves first to a tiny town called Tostes, where Charles, a kind of low-grade doctor, sets up a medical practice. Soon enough, though, Emma is bored, sick of Charles, and incredibly depressed.The couple attends a ball given by a local aristocrat; there, Emma gets a glimpse of the opulent lifestyle she longs for. Her depression worsens after this life-changing event, and the young couple moves to a slightly larger town, Yonville-l'Abbaye, in an attempt to make her feel better.Emma, who is pregnant during the move, is slightly soothed by her friendship with another young person, Leon Dupuis, a clerk in Yonville. Leon lives with the family of Monsieur Homais, the town pharmacist. Monsieur Homais also quickly befriends the Bovarys for his own reasons.After Emma has her baby, Berthe, she and Leon grow even closer. Slowly, they both realize that they're in love - but they're both too shy to do anything about it. Leon moves away to Paris to study, and Emma, left alone, falls back into a slump.However, her unhappiness doesn't last too long this time - she quickly meets another handsome bachelor, Rodolphe Boulanger. He's quite a womanizer, and he decides to take Emma as his mistress. It doesn't take much convincing to win her over, and Emma quickly succumbs to the temptations of adultery.Emma starts taking out huge loans from a local merchant, and quickly slides into debt. However, she doesn't care; all that matters to her is Rodolphe. They have a tumultuous relationship for two years, but it eventually comes to a dramatic stop. Rodolphe is bored with Emma, and he abandons her just as they're supposed to run away together. He goes the super-wussy route of writing her a break-up letter, and doesn't even deliver it himself.This devastates Emma. She goes into shock and her health declines rapidly. Charles doesn't know what to do; mostly, he just prescribes odd and useless medications. The Bovary family's finances get even worse, and Charles is forced to take out additional loans. Emma slowly starts to recover. As a treat, Monsieur Homais suggests that Charles take the little lady to the opera in Rouen, the nearest city. It turns out to be a fateful trip.At the theatre, Charles and Emma happen to run into Leon, who has finished law school and moved to Rouen. He's become more worldly and is no longer afraid of Emma. They fling themselves into a passionate affair. She grows craftier and craftier, and figures out different schemes to visit the city to see her lover.However, after a while, even this affair starts to peter out. Emma's money troubles get worse and worse, as does her relationship with Leon. One day when she returns to Yonville, she discovers that she owes an incredibly huge sum of money, and can't possibly pay it back. Disaster!Emma rushes around, attempting to borrow cash from everyone she knows. The answer everywhere is ""no."" She tries Leon, to no avail; she even goes back to Rodolphe to ask him to take her back , but has no luck with anyone. Desperate, afraid to tell Charles, and completely hopeless, Emma gives in to her despair and poisons herself by taking arsenic. She dies a truly gruesome death, as her friends and family look on in horror.After Emma's death, things go even more downhill for Charles and little Berthe. They're totally broke. And their finances are made even worse by the fact that Charles, who's still in love with his dead wife despite the proof of her adultery, refuses to sell any of Emma's extravagant possessions. He dies, poverty-stricken and lonely. Berthe is sent to live with her grandmother, who then dies as well. The young girl finally ends up living with a poor aunt, working as a child laborer in a cotton mill.Ironically, the only character to achieve a happy ending is the determined, obnoxious, over-ambitious, and undeserving apothecary, Monsieur Homais."
A Tale of Two Cities,"It is 1775, and Mr. Jarvis Lorry is traveling to Dover to meet Lucie Manette. He tells her that she is not an orphan as she had been told from a young age. He now says that he will travel with her to Paris to meet her father, who has recently been released from the Bastille. Doctor Manette is housed in the Defarges' wine-shop and has lost his reason, but he starts to regain it when he meets his daughter and is transported back to London. Five years later, Charles Darnay is tried in London on a charge of treason for providing English secrets to the French and Americans during the outbreak of the American Revolution. The dramatic appearance of Mr. Sydney Carton, who looks remarkably like him, precludes any positive identification and allows Darnay's acquittal. Darnay, Mr. Carton, and Mr. Stryver all fall in love with Lucie Manette, who was a tearful, unwilling witness for the prosecution. Although they all make an attempt to woo her, she favors Charles Darnay and marries him. Carton comes to her house alone and declares that while he expects no return of his love, he would do anything for her or for anyone whom she loves. Darnay has ominously hinted to Doctor Manette of his concealed identity, and he reveals to his father-in-law on the morning of his wedding that he is a French nobleman who has renounced his title. In France, Darnay's uncle, Monseigneur, has been murdered in his bed for crimes against the French people. This means that Darnay is next in line to inherit the aristocratic title, but he tells no one but Doctor Manette. At the urgent request of Monsieur Gabelle, who has been arbitrarily imprisoned, Darnay returns to Paris. He is arrested as a nobleman and an emigrant and thrown into jail. A spy named John Barsad drops into the Defarges' wine-shop to gather evidence regarding whether they are revolutionaries. They reveal practically nothing, although Madame Defarge is knitting a list of those whom she and the other revolutionaries intend to kill. Doctor Manette, Miss Pross, Lucie, and her small child follow Darnay to Paris, where the Doctor is almost successful in using his power among the revolutionaries as a former Bastille prisoner--like the people, he was oppressed by the ruling regime--to secure Darnay's release. But Darnay is once again denounced by the Defarges, a charge which is made even stronger by Monsieur Defarge's revelation of a paper document that he found in Doctor Manette's former cell in the Bastille. The document recounts that Manette was arbitrarily imprisoned by the Evremondes for having witnessed their rape of a peasant girl and the murder of her brother. Darnay is brought back to prison and sentenced to death. Sydney Carton also has traveled to Paris because of the selfless love that Lucie Manette has inspired in him. He resolves to sacrifice himself to save her husband's life. He forces the help of John Barsad, having recognized him as Solomon Pross, the dissolute brother of Miss Pross. Carton overhears the Defarges discussing a plan to kill Lucie and her child, and he figures out that Madame Defarge is the surviving sister of the peasant girl who was raped and of the boy who was stabbed by the Evremonde family. Carton arranges for the Manettes to leave immediately. He uses his influence with Barsad , who also works as a turnkey, to get into Darnay's cell. He drugs Darnay and exchanges places with him, having Barsad carry Darnay out of the prison to safety. Madame Defarge knocks on Lucie's door to arrest her, but the Manettes have already fled to safety. She is instead confronted with the extremely protective Miss Pross, who comes to blows with her and accidentally shoots her dead with her own gun. Darnay returns with the Manettes to London in safety. Carton dies in Darnay's place at the guillotine, satisfied with the knowledge of his good deed."
The Secret Agent,"Adolf Verloc, a secret agent in the employ of the Embassy, has been embedded in the socialist Red Committee in London. He is summoned to the Embassy to meet with First Secretary Mr. Vladimir, who berates him for the lack of concrete results from his work; instead of just preventing attacks, Mr. Verloc is ordered to lead his radical associates to carry out a terrorist act that will strike at the very fabric of the British middle class, so that they will finally allow for repressive legislation. Mr. Verloc--who lives with his wife Winnie, her mentally handicapped brother Stevie, and her mother in their shop selling shady wares--hosts Red Committee members Michaelis, Comrade Ossipon, and Karl Yundt. The radicals are quick to spout vainglorious statements, but Mr. Verloc despairs of their being able to accomplish the extraordinary act Mr. Vladimir has asked him to produce. On a later date, Ossipon meets with the Professor, an eccentric, solitary man who produces explosives. Ossipon shows him a newspaper article about the Greenwich Bomb Outrage that had taken place in Greenwich Park that morning: a bomb meant for the Greenwich Royal Observatory detonated prematurely and blew the bomber to pieces without injuring anyone or causing any damage. The article says that Mr. Verloc was the killed bomber. Leaving from their meeting, the Professor runs into Chief Inspector Heat, a police officer who has just investigated the scene of the bombing. After letting the Professor off, Heat meets with the Assistant Commissioner, his superior, and reveals his former acquaintance with Mr. Verloc. The Assistant Commissioner, annoyed by what Heat has been keeping from him, complains in turn to his own superior, Sir Ethelred, the Home Secretary, about the danger of using secret agents like Mr. Verloc. After his meeting, he walks to Mr. Verloc's shop. In the past few weeks, Mr. Verloc has spent some time in Europe; since coming back, he has been taking long walks with Stevie. Mrs. Verloc, who cares as a mother for her highly sensitive and easily devoted brother, is glad to see her husband seemingly taking care of the boy. However, on the day of the Bomb Outrage, Mr. Verloc, who has in fact not been killed, comes back home looking physically ill. After a visit from Mr. Vladimir and another from Chief Inspector Heat, Mrs. Verloc learns that Mr. Verloc had given Stevie a bomb for the Greenwich Observatory but that Stevie tripped and let the bomb off early. At first, Mrs. Verloc is mute with shock, but then her years-long resentment towards her husband surges up, and she stabs him fatally. Terrified by the prospect of being hanged as a murder, she goes to commit suicide from a bridge. On her way, she runs into Ossipon and begs him to escape with her to the Continent. However, when Ossipon sees the dead Mr. Verloc at their home, he becomes terribly confused and frightened and ends up abandoning Mrs. Verloc on a train to the port. She later commits suicide on the passenger liner as it crosses the English Channel."
Jane Eyre,"Ten-year-old orphan Jane Eyre lives unhappily with her wealthy relatives, the Reed family, at Gateshead. Resentful of the late Mr. Reed's preference for her, Jane's aunt and cousins take every opportunity to neglect and abuse her as a reminder of her inferior station. Jane's only salvation from her daily humiliations is Bessie, the kindly servant who tells her stories and sings her songs. One day, Jane confronts her bullying cousin, John, and Mrs. Reed punishes her by imprisoning her in the ""red-room,"" the room in which her uncle died. Convinced that she sees her uncle's ghost, Jane faints. When she awakes, Jane is being cared for the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, who suggests that she be sent off to school. Mrs. Reed is happy to be rid of her troublesome charge and immediately sends Jane to the Lowood School, an institution fifty miles from Gateshead. Jane soon discovers that life at the Lowood School is bleak, particularly because of the influence of the hypocritical headmaster, Mr. Brocklehurst, whose cruelty and evangelical self-righteousness results in poor conditions, inedible meals, and frequent punishments for the students. During an inspection of the school, Mr. Brocklehurst humiliates Jane by forcing to stand on a stool in the middle of the class and accusing her of being a liar. The beautiful superintendent, Miss Temple, believes in Jane's innocence and writes to Mr. Lloyd for clarification of Jane's nature. Although Jane continues to suffer privations in the austere environment, Miss Temple's benevolence encourages her to devote herself to her studies. While at Lowood, Jane also befriends Helen Burns, who upholds a doctrine of Christian forgiveness and tolerance. Helen is constantly mistreated by Miss Scratcherd, one of the more unpleasant teachers at the school, but maintains her passivity and ""turns the other cheek."" Although Jane is unable to accept Helen's doctrine completely - her passionate nature cannot allow her to endure mistreatment silently- Jane attempts to mirror Helen's patience and calmness in her own character. During the spring, an outbreak of typhus fever ravages the school, and Helen dies of consumption in Jane's arms. The deaths by typhus alert the benefactors to the school's terrible conditions, and it is revealed that Mr. Brocklehurst has been embezzling school funds in order to provide for his own luxurious lifestyle. After Mr. Brocklehurst's removal, Jane's time at Lowood is spent more happily and she excels as a student for six years and as a teacher for two. Despite her security at Lowood, Jane is dissatisfied and yearns for new adventures. She accepts a position as governess at Thornfield Manor and is responsible for teaching a vivacious French girl named Adele. In addition to Adele, Jane spends much of her time at Thornfield with Mrs. Fairfax, the elderly housekeeper who runs the estate during the master's absence. Jane also begins to notice some mysterious happenings around Thornfield, including the master's constant absence from home and the demonic laugh that Jane hears emanating from the third-story attic. After much waiting, Jane finally meets her employer, Edward Rochester, a brooding, detached man who seems to have a dark past. Although Mr. Rochester is not handsome in the traditional sense, Jane feels an immediate attraction to him based on their intellectual communion. One night, Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire in his bedroom, which he blames on Grace Poole, a seamstress with a propensity for gin. Because Grace continues to work at Thornfield, Jane decides that Mr. Rochester has withheld some important information about the incident. As the months go by, Jane finds herself falling more and more in love with Mr. Rochester, even after he tells her of his lustful liaison with Adele's mother. However, Jane becomes convinced that Mr. Rochester would never return her affection when he brings the beautiful Blanche Ingram to visit at Thornfield. Though Rochester flirts with the idea of marrying Miss Ingram, he is aware of her financial ambitions for marriage. During Miss Ingram's visit, an old acquaintance of Rochester's, Richard Mason, also visits Thornfield and is severely injured from an attack - apparently by Grace - in the middle of the night in the attic. Jane, baffled by the circumstances, tends to him, and Rochester confesses to her that he made an error in the past that he hopes to overturn by marrying Miss Ingram. He says that he has another governess position for Jane lined up elsewhere. Jane returns to Gateshead for a few weeks to see the dying Mrs. Reed. Mrs. Reed still resents Jane and refuses to apologize for mistreating her as a child; she also admits that she lied to Jane's uncle, John Eyre, and told him that she had died during the typhus outbreak at Lowood. When Jane returns to Thornfield, Rochester tells her that he knows Miss Ingram's true motivations for marriage, and he asks Jane to marry him. Jane accepts, but a month later, Mason and a solicitor, Mr. Briggs, interrupt the wedding ceremony by revealing that Rochester already has a wife: Mason's sister, Bertha, who is kept in the attic in Thornfield under the care of Grace Poole. Rochester confesses his past misdeeds to Jane. In his youth he needed to marry the wealthy Bertha for money, but was unaware of her family's history of madness. Despite his best efforts to help her, Bertha eventually descended into a state of complete madness that only her imprisonment could control. Jane still loves Mr. Rochester, but she cannot allow herself to become his mistress: she leaves Thornfield. Penniless and devastated by Mr. Rochester's revelations, Jane is reduced to begging for food and sleeping outdoors. Fortunately, the Rivers siblings, St. John , Diana, and Mary, take her into their home at Moor House and help her to regain her strength. Jane becomes close friends with the family, and quickly develops a great affection for the ladies. Although the stoically religious St. John is difficult to approach, he finds Jane a position working as a teacher at a school in Morton. One day, Jane learns that she has inherited a vast fortune of 20,000 pounds from her uncle, John Eyre. Even more surprising, Jane discovers that the Rivers siblings are actually her cousins. Jane immediately decides to share her newfound wealth with her relatives. St. John is going to go on missionary work in India and repeatedly asks Jane to accompany him as his wife. She refuses, since it would mean compromising her capacity for passion in a loveless marriage. Instead, she is drawn to thoughts of Mr. Rochester and, one day, after experiencing a mystical connection with him, seeks him out at Thornfield. She discovers that the estate has been burned down by Bertha, who died in the fire, and that Mr. Rochester, who lost his eyesight and one of his hands in the fire, lives at the nearby estate of Ferndean. He is overjoyed when she locates him, and relates his side of the mystical connection that Jane had. He and Jane soon marry. At the end of the novel, Jane informs the readers that she and Mr. Rochester have been married for ten years, and Mr. Rochester regained sight in one of his eyes in time to see the birth of his first son."
The Pickwick Papers,"In May 1827, the Pickwick Club of London, headed by Samuel Pickwick, decides to establish a traveling society in which four members journey about England and make reports on their travels. The four members are Mr. Pickwick, a kindly retired businessman and philosopher whose thoughts never rise above the commonplace; Tracy Tupman, a ladies' man who never makes a conquest; Augustus Snodgrass, a poet who never writes a poem; and Nathaniel Winkle, a sportsman of tremendous ineptitude. The Pickwickians meet to begin their first journey and get knocked about by an angry cabman, who thinks they are informers, while an angry crowd gathers. They are rescued by Alfred Jingle, who travels with them to Rochester. Jingle is an adventurer interested in wealthy women, and on this first trip he involves the innocent Winkle in a duel with Dr. Slammer, a hot-tempered army man. At Chatham, the Pickwickians watch army maneuvers, get buffeted about, and meet Mr. Wardle, a country squire who invites them to his estate at Dingley Dell. After some mishaps with horses, Mr. Pickwick and his friends arrive at Mr. Wardle's Manor Farm, where they enjoy card games, flirting, storytelling, hunting, and a cricket match. Mr. Tupman falls in love with Mr. Wardle's spinster sister, Rachael; and Mr. Snodgrass falls in love with his daughter, Emily. However, Tupman is outsmarted by the vivacious, unscrupulous Jingle, who elopes with Rachael. Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Wardle pursue Jingle and Rachael to London, where, with the help of a lawyer, Mr. Perker, they buy off Jingle and save Rachael Wardle from an unhappy marriage. In London Mr. Pickwick comes across Sam Weller, a boot cleaner and general handyman whom he takes on as a valet. Sam is a cockney man of the world: witty, intelligent, handy with his fists. When Mr. Pickwick tells his widowed landlady, Mrs. Bardell, that he has taken on a servant, she assumes from the ambiguous way he puts it that he intends to marry her. Mrs. Bardell faints in his arms just as Tupman, Snodgrass, and Winkle enter -- a compromising circumstance. Sam Weller's father, Tony, a coachman who had the misfortune to marry a widow, provides a running commentary through the novel on the dangers of matrimony. Tony's wife has taken up with a hypocritical, alcoholic evangelist and makes life miserable for her husband until her death. Both Tony Weller and Mr. Pickwick are prey for widows, because Mrs. Bardell soon starts a breach-of-promise suit against Mr. Pickwick. Meanwhile, Mr. Pickwick and his friends go to Eatanswill to witness an election, which is both violent and nonsensical. Mr. Pickwick and Winkle stay with Mr. Pott, the editor of a partisan newspaper, and Winkle unwittingly becomes involved in Pott's domestic fights. During their visit to Eatanswill the Pickwickians are invited to a costume party given by the local literary lioness, Mrs. Leo Hunter, where several varieties of silliness are exhibited. At this party Mr. Pickwick sees Alfred Jingle, whom he pursues to a neighboring town. Jingle's servant tells Mr. Pickwick that Jingle has designs on a young lady at a boarding school, and Mr. Pickwick decides to prevent the elopement. However, this information is a ruse that leads to Mr. Pickwick's embarrassment and an attack of rheumatism. The Pickwickians assemble at Bury St. Edmunds, where Mr. Wardle is on a hunting trip, and Mr. Pickwick recovers enough to go along. There he learns that Mrs. Bardell has filed suit against him through Dodson and Fogg, a pair of rascally lawyers. So Mr. Pickwick returns to London to see about getting legal help. In London, Mr. Pickwick learns that Jingle is in Ipswich and goes there to expose him. Because of a mix-up in bedrooms at an Ipswich Inn Mr. Pickwick is hauled before the justice, a local henpecked tyrant called Mr. Nupkins. Nupkins is visited frequently by Jingle, who is interested in the daughter. Mr. Pickwick extricates himself by proving that Jingle is an adventurer. Eventually the Pickwickians return to the Wardle farm to celebrate Christmas and the wedding of Mr. Wardle's daughter, Isabella. Amid festivities Snodgrass continues his romance with Emily, and Winkle falls in love with Arabella Allen, a friend of Mr. Wardle's daughters. On Valentine's Day, 1831, Mr. Pickwick is tried for breach of promise. Due to the rhetorical allegations of Serjeant Buzfuz and to the circumstantial evidence, Mr. Pickwick is found guilty and ordered to pay damages, which he refuses to do. Since it is two months before Dodson and Fogg can have him jailed, the Pickwickians make a trip to Bath. There Winkle gets into more difficulties over a middle-aged woman and flees to Bristol, where he learns that his sweetheart, Arabella Allen, has been hidden by her brother. Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick arrive in Bristol, where they help Winkle find Arabella in order to declare his intentions. On returning to London, Mr. Pickwick is taken to the Fleet Prison for debtors because he will not pay damages. In prison he witnesses much misery, filth, and squalor and for a brief time he is victimized by two predatory inmates. There he finds Alfred Jingle and his servant in utter destitution and gives them some assistance. Mr. Pickwick tells Sam Weller to leave him, but Sam has himself jailed for debt to be with his kindly master. Dismayed by the misery of prison, Mr. Pickwick rents a cell by himself and comes out only in the evenings. When Mrs. Bardell is arrested and jailed because she cannot pay her lawyers, Mr. Pickwick begins to soften. Further, Winkle has married Arabella and needs Mr. Pickwick to intercede for them with her brother and his own father. Finally Mr. Pickwick decides to pay costs, which releases himself and Mrs. Bardell, and he also pays Jingle's debts. Mr. Pickwick goes to Bristol to tell Ben Allen about Arabella's marriage, and Ben adjusts to the fact with the help of much liquor. Mr. Pickwick then goes to Birmingham to tell Winkle's father, who appears angry and disgusted by the news. Back in London Mr. Pickwick pays Dodson and Fogg, sends Jingle and his servant to the West Indies to begin afresh, and learns that Emily Wardle is planning to elope with Snodgrass. Mr. Pickwick convinces Mr. Wardle that Snodgrass is a worthy gentleman, and the couple are married in Mr. Pickwick's newly purchased home. In the meantime Sam Weller has been courting a pretty housemaid named Mary, and under Mr. Pickwick's auspices they are married. And, though the London Pickwick Club has been dissolved, Samuel Pickwick lives to be godfather to many children."
Mansfield Park,"Mansfield Park thematically centers on the issue of morality in three different layers of society: the aristocratic Bertrams, the fashionable, city-dwelling Crawfords, and the down-and-out Prices. Although the protagonist, Fanny Price, is merely a poor, shy relation, more than willing to be marginalized by the effusive Bertrams and the sophisticated Crawfords, she surpasses them all through her innate sense of morality and familial duty. Although she loves Edmund Bertram, she keeps her feelings to herself because she realizes he loves Mary Crawford. She refuses to manipulate him into thinking otherwise, even though she herself realizes Mary is manipulative and disingenuous. Furthermore, although she has the opportunity to marry Henry Crawford, she forgoes the chance to be rich and socially elevated in hopes that she will find true love. In the end, Fanny emerges triumphant because she sees those around her for what they truly are. By remaining true to her own values, she wins Edmund's love, as well as the respect and adoration of everyone at Mansfield Park. As a poor nine-year-old, Fanny Price comes to live with Lady Bertram and Sir Thomas Bertram at their estate, Mansfield Park. Fanny is ill-treated by her other aunt, Mrs. Norris, and is looked down upon by her cousins: Tom, the eldest, who likes to drink and gamble, and the cruel Maria and Julia, who want to have nothing to do with Fanny because she doesn't have fashionable clothes. Edmund, the younger Bertram son, who is destined to be a clergyman, is kind to Fanny, and becomes her dearest friend. Fanny spends the rest of her childhood in this luxurious environment, but is constantly reminded of her status. She remains at the beck and call of both of her aunts, knowing full well that if she isn't obliging, she could very well be thrown out. In time, Tom Bertram's gambling debts and wild behavior cause Sir Thomas serious financial troubles. He is forced to leave Mansfield Park for Antigua, where he owns plantations, and must allow another parson, Dr. Grant, to replace Mr. Norris after he dies, instead of holding the parsonage in abeyance for his younger son, Edmund. In his absence, Mary and Henry Crawford, the much younger siblings of Mrs. Grant, arrive from London and take up temporary residence at the parsonage. Henry and Mary are attractive and sophisticated, and quickly become welcome guests at Mansfield Park. Henry flirts openly with the Bertram daughters - Maria, who has just become engaged to the wealthy Mr. Rushworth, and Julia, the younger daughter. Mary becomes interested in Edmund, although she does not realize that he is destined for the clergy. To complicate matters, Fanny comes to realize that over the years she has fallen in love with Edmund. When Tom Bertram returns to Mansfield Park, he brings his friend Yates with him. Tom's suggestion that the group stage a play that Yates has been yearning to produce is met with great exuberance by all except Edmund and Fanny, who are horrified at the idea of acting because it would not be condoned by Sir Thomas, were he present. Despite their feelings, the production of the scandalous Lovers' Vows gathers steam. To Fanny's great relief, Sir Thomas returns from Antigua the day before the play's debut. He is furious with the improper behavior of his family in his absence, and appreciates Fanny's objections to the performance. Although Maria is attracted to Henry Crawford, she nevertheless marries Rushworth for his money and estate and leaves Mansfield Park for London with her sister, Julia. Edmund's relationship with Mary Crawford continues to grow - much to Fanny's dismay. She is Edmund's confidante, and he has no idea of her true feelings for him. Henry turns to Fanny for admiration while Maria and Julia are away, and in time realizes that he has in fact fallen in love with her. When her brother William comes to Mansfield Park for a visit a ball is given in Fanny's honor, and Mary Crawford manages to give Fanny a secret gift of a cross from Henry. He also recommends Fanny's brother to his Admiral uncle for a naval promotion, after which he proposes to Fanny. She refuses his offer, but he will not take no for an answer. Sir Thomas thinks she should accept Henry's proposal so that she will have an easier life, as the mistress of his estate. He believes that a visit to her original home in Portsmouth will force her to consent to Henry's proposal. Fanny is devastated upon returning to her parents, who live in a tiny, filthy house with an overabundance of disobedient children. Her parents hardly notice her, but she finds a friend in her sister, Susan. Every day she waits to be called back to Mansfield, and every day she is disappointed. When Henry comes to visit and treats her and her family so well, she begins to waver in her decision not to marry him, and is almost disappointed to see him leave. Meanwhile, she receives letters from Mary Crawford urging her to accept Henry as her husband. Fanny can see that Henry has put Mary up to this since he cannot write to her himself - young ladies at this time could not accept letters from men to whom they weren't at least engaged. As a result of his playboy lifestyle, Tom Bertram becomes deathly ill, and is forced to return to Mansfield Park to convalesce. Upon leaving Fanny at Portsmouth, Henry Crawford goes to London and runs off with Mrs. Rushworth, otherwise known as Maria Bertram. Julia Bertram elopes with Tom's friend, Mr. Yates. With all of these goings-on, the whole family is distressed, and Fanny is called back to Mansfield. Lady Bertram writes to Fanny and asks her to bring her fourteen-year-old sister with her, and Edmund immediately comes to collect them. He admits that Mary Crawford finally showed her true colors by intimating to him that things might be better off for them if Tom died. Edmund would then become the heir to the estate, and would not have to continue as a minister. He will never marry, Edmund tells Fanny. In a short while, as might be expected, Henry leaves the disgraced Maria, who is forced to live with her aunt, Mrs. Norris. Julia and Yates are in time accepted by the family, and Edmund comes to look upon Fanny with the eyes of love. After marrying, they move to the parsonage, Susan replaces Fanny at Mansfield Park, and all live happily ever after."
Typee,"The driveway up to the big house is long, here. Melville begins Typee with a discussion of what it's like to the live on the sea, and how western European governments have lately sought to bring ""civilization"" to various native tribes. His fictional avatar , Tom, has taken to seafaring in the name of a little adventure. But they've been on the water for a long time without sight of land, and Tom is hungering for some non-salt-preserved meat and everything else that solid ground can offer. When it becomes clear that his captain is disinterested in spending any time land-bound, he decides to defect from the crew. His mate Toby has a similar idea, and they tromp off A.S.A.P. when the boat stops for an afternoon of R&R on an island in the Marquesas, which is occupied by the French. After waiting for their ship to move on, they figure they'll circle around and catch a boat back to the UK. Predictably , the plan doesn't go quite as smoothly as expected; rather, Tom and Toby's adventure on the island is just beginning. After a wretched over-land haul--including very little food and sleep, treacherous cliffs, and rain that soaks the friends to the bone--the men arrive in a valley settlement of a native tribe. Tom has sustained a semi-serious injury to his leg and is glad to have a chance to rest. Unfortunately, they're not sure if the people are Typee or Happar . A language barrier prevents them from figuring this out. Tired and hungry and wet, they decide to risk it and accept the extravagant welcome of the native people. At first, things are just fine. Tommo and Toby relax, eating breadfruit and sleeping in a family's hut. The women are beautiful, the men respectful, and, with careful pantomiming, the sailors and the natives can even understand each other some of the time. However, it becomes clear that the people are indeed Typee. But they seem nice enough for the time being, so the two men decide to proceed cautiously as Tommo's leg worsens. They make a plan for Toby to head to the French-occupied bay nearby, so they gather first aid supplies, and Toby makes departure as soon as possible. His first attempt to leave the valley goes poorly, though, and he sustains an injury at the hands of a Happar weapon. His second attempt seems to go better, as he runs with some of the Typee to meet boats arriving to the bay. But when the Typee return, they tell Tommo conflicting stories: that Toby has left, or died, or is on his way back. He does not return, and Tommo must--with a lame leg--settle in and hope for some means for escape. As time passes, Tommo manages a pleasant kind of life, forging a special friendship with a young lady named Fayaway, and becoming friendly with Kory-Kory--his designated manservant. He learns of the plants and animals in the valley, watches the Typee weave and build, and over and over is taken aback by the beauty of the nature surrounding him. He learns about the Typee culture, visiting their hallowed temple grounds , and the system of ""taboos,"" or rules of conduct, for the tribe. The women, for example, are not allowed in boats, and each of the tattoos each tribal member receives has a special story or meaning. As much fun as Tommo is having, however, his leg is improving and he's getting more and more desperate to escape. The Typee seem to want to keep him in their valley, and he slowly realizes that, though he is well-treated and quite comfortable, he is a prisoner nonetheless. Ignorant of their endgame, and with questions of cannibalism still floating in his head, Tommo becomes increasingly depressed and restless. There's been no sign of Toby, and it becomes clear that he must find a way to leave on his own. Four months have passed since Tommo's arrived in the valley. Through a careful system of patience and planning and pretending to get a drink of water, he tries to escape. Yeah...it doesn't really work out. But when, one day, he hears there's a boat on the nearby beach, nothing will stop him. Some of his Typee pals-captors say okay, but others give him some trouble. But Tommo is stubborn and loud and, with the sheer force of will, he is allowed to make it to the shore. There, he is greeted by an old whaling ship, which is manned by a crew that includes a Hawaiian native sailor he knows from his old ship. Although the natives still attempt to prevent him by force from leaving, with the help of a carefully placed boat hook as a weapon, he just makes it on board. Later, he's conveyed to a British whaling ship in need of a crew. There, he's taken good care of, and his leg eventually heals. In the final chapter, Tommo reveals the fate of Toby. As he had made his way out of the valley and toward the beach, a fight broke out between Typees and Happars, with spears flying through the air. Toby attempts to wait it out, before realizing it is actually a play fight, and it's just another ruse to prevent him from meeting ships. By the time he got the beach, there were no signs of ships. But, there was an old sailor named Jimmy who had ""gone native."" After some negotiations with the Typee, Jimmy told Toby that he would be allowed to leave, without Tommo. After convincing him that he had no other choice, Toby was forced to trust Jimmy, who told the natives that Toby would be back soon. After a stop at Jimmy's Happar home, Toby leaves the island, quite regretfully without Tommo, on a French boat. An epilogue notes that Tommo was at sea for two more years after the close of this story, and that only ten days after the publication of this book, Toby and Tommo happened to meet, and thus the story of Toby's fate was added to later editions."
Anne of Green Gables,"Anne of Green Gables is the story of a young orphan girl, Anne, who is mistakenly delivered to an older couple looking to adopt a boy to work on their farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island. After the couple meets Anne, they decide to keep her despite her not being of the appropriate gender. Anne soon makes her home on the farm and often finds herself in conflict with her adoptive mother and other local women, as she has trouble acting like a ""proper lady"" and abiding by standard rules of etiquette and social expectations. Anne becomes close friends with her neighbor, Diana, and begins to attend school in Avonlea. She has her fair share of conflict with Diana and other classmates as well, including an incident where she accidentally gets Diana drunk from red currant wine, as well as an ongoing conflict with Gilbert, a classmate who makes fun of Anne's red hair, causing her to lash out and develop a rivalry with him. Anne's and Gilbert's intelligence lands them each a place at the prestigious Queen's Academy, and the two develop a more friendly relationship despite the persisting rivalry between them. While attending the academy, Anne puts excellent effort into her studies and earns the Avery Scholarship, awarding her money to fund her tuition for a four-year college, should she choose to enroll in the fall. However, Anne's adoptive father dies of a heart attack, and her adoptive mother, Marilla, is losing her eyesight and likely to go blind. Instead of attending a four-year college and earning her degree, Anne chooses to remain at Green Gables and help Marilla manage the farm. After hearing of Anne's situation, Gilbert sacrifices his job as a teacher at the Avonlea school so Anne may teach there while remaining close to Marilla and to Green Gables. Anne and Gilbert become close friends and Anne looks forward to her future, despite the obstacles she has had and will have to overcome."
A Little Princess,"A Little Princess begins with seven-year-old Sara Crewe's journey from India, where she has been raised by her father, to London, where she is to attend boarding school. Before bidding her farewell, her doting father gives her extravagant gifts including custom-made clothes and a beautiful doll, which she names Emily. The father and daughter say an emotional farewell before Captain Crewe returns to India. Sara desperately misses her father, but survives on the strength of her friendliness and active imagination. She tells exciting stories, which make her popular among her classmates, and she enjoys pretending that her doll, Emily, is capable of thinking and understanding her. Sara's new friends in this period include Ermengarde, a well-intentioned but rather dull classmate who looks up to her, and Lottie, the school's youngest student, who accepts Sara as a kind of surrogate mother. Moreover, Sara's extreme wealth gains her favor with the school's leadership. Miss Minchin, the headmistress, dislikes Sara but treats her well out of a materialistic desire for her family's money. Some students, such as Sara's rival Lavinia, envy her wealth, but Sara is constantly selfless and unspoiled. She goes out of her way to share food, toys, and resources with those who lack them, especially the mistreated scullery maid, a young girl named Becky. In fact, Sara imagines herself to be a princess who betters the lives of her subjects. By the time of her eleventh birthday, Sara is the school's most popular and academically advanced student. She expects to become even wealthier, since her father is planning to invest in lucrative diamond mines. But during Sara's opulent eleventh birthday celebration, her life comes crashing down. Her father's solicitor arrives and informs Miss Minchin that Sara's father has died with his finances in shambles, leaving her penniless. Miss Minchin vengefully turns on Sara, immediately taking away her living space, toys, and lessons. Sara is sent to live in a chilly, rat-infested attic with Becky. Instead of seeing friends and learning lessons, she is asked to complete menial tasks and to help younger students with lessons. A mixture of loyal friends and imagination sustain her in this period. She imagines that she is a deposed princess, a soldier, or a prisoner in the Bastille. She even imagines that one of the rats in her attic, who she calls Melchisedec, is capable of human-like thoughts and feelings--a fantasy that the author playfully implies is accurate. Moreover, Becky, Lottie, and Ermengarde remain close with Sara. They visit her room, even when doing so is forbidden, and do their best to share food and books with her. Sara's life begins to seem irredeemably miserable. Miss Minchin does not provide her with enough food, and she is nearly starved. When she leaves school to run errands, strangers notice both how poor she clearly is and how dignified she acts. A bakery proprietor is shocked to see Sara give away the little food she can afford to an even poorer child. A family who live next door debate whether or not Sara is a ""beggar,"" since her evident poverty contrasts with her upper-class mannerisms. In spite of her evident starvation, Miss Minchin denies her any relief. When Ermengarde tries to deliver a stash of food to Sara and Becky, for instance, Miss Minchin interrupts and threatens to punish all three girls. Little does Sara know, though, that various strangers are interested in her well-being. The family who lives nearby finds her intriguing, as does a sickly, aging bachelor who has recently moved into the neighborhood from India. The man, Mr. Carrisford, has brought his servant Ram Dass over from India. One day, Sara speaks to Ram Dass and his pet monkey through the window in their adjoining attics. Afterward, Ram Dass--with Carrisford's blessing--begins to leave Sara presents and food in her room while she is sleeping or running errands. Sara's life significantly improves with these gifts, though she does not know they come from Carrisford and Ram Dass. Meanwhile, Carrisford is desperately searching for the young, lost daughter of his old friend Ralph Crewe. In other words, he is looking for Sara herself, though he is unaware that the poor servant girl next door is the child he seeks. One day, Sara enters Carrisford's house to return Ram Dass's monkey, who has wandered into her room. She casually mentions her upbringing in India, which intrigues Carrisford. Sara then explains her story, and Carrisford realizes that she is Ralph Crewe's missing daughter. He tells her that her father's fortune was in fact never lost and will be restored to her. He becomes Sara's new guardian, and the two become extremely close. Moreover, Sara is allowed to remain friends with Ermengarde and Lottie, and she takes Becky in as her own personal servant."
Regeneration,"Regeneration opens with Siegfried Sassoon's famous anti-war letter and then dives into the furor that the lieutenant's protest generated. The British military, worried about public opinion turning against a war for which there is no end in sight, mobilizes to undercut Sassoon's critique. Graves, a fellow officer, poet and friend, convinces Sassoon that his protest will not result in the controversial court-martial he desires, but in public embarrassment instead. Therefore, Sassoon agrees to be committed to Craiglockhart, a mental hospital, thus admitting to a psychological break-down and effectively neutralizing his critique. Sassoon's treatment is entrusted to Dr. Rivers, an accomplished anthropologist and psychologist who champions remembering and processing traumatic memories as form of treatment for shell-shock. The psychologist is impressed with Sassoon's rational state of mind and commitment to his beliefs, but warns the lieutenant that he is tasked with ensuring Sassoon's return the front. Dr. Rivers, like Graves, believes that soldiers have a duty to fight regardless of their opinions about the war. Though ostensibly sane, Sassoon establishes a schedule for therapy with Dr. Rivers. The lieutenant is one of many officers staying at Craiglockhart. During dinner, Sassoon meets Anderson, a combat medic who fears blood. Their talk is interrupted by a skeletal man named Burns who is vomiting up his meal. Burns was thrown by an explosion and landed on the decomposing corpse of a German soldier; any time he attempts to eat, the taste and smell of rotting flesh come back to him. Later, Billy Prior, a stubborn young officer with working-class roots, arrives at the hospital. He is suffering from mutism. In order to cure these troubled soldiers, Dr. Rivers uses psychoanalysis, pushing his patients to speak about the memories that haunt them. Prior recovers his speech and immediately begins to taunt Dr. Rivers, refusing to recall the trauma that left him mute in the first place. He repeatedly requests hypnosis, insisting that it is the only way he will recover the memory. Later, Burns walks through the English country-side and, in a surreal sequence, finds a tree with dead animals hanging from its boughs. Terrified, he turns to run but forces himself to face his fears. He returns to the tree, removes the dead animals, and arranges them in a circle around the trunk. Burns then peels off his clothes and lies down in the center of the circle, thinking about death. Only his attachment to Dr. Rivers forces him to return to the hospital. Dr. Rivers realizes that being forced to re-experience traumatic memories can cause his patients significant emotional difficulty, which worries him. He dreams about the experiments he conducted at Cambridge with his friend Henry Head. Head had voluntarily severed the nerve in his arm in order to chart its regeneration. Dr. Rivers would prick his friend's arm with a pin and measure the level of pain; Head often experienced unbelievable anguish. The psychologist is disturbed by the thought of causing pain to both his friend and his patients, even in the name of recovery. Yet Dr. Rivers believes in the power of his methods and concludes that he must continue his treatment. Sassoon becomes a friend and mentor to Wilfred Owen, another officer and aspiring poet who is star-struck when he first meets the decorated lieutenant. A successful and published poet, Sassoon pushes Owen to write about his war experiences and hone his craft. Over time, Owen's writing improves. He shows Sassoon a moving anti-war poem and eventually agrees to publish his own work in the hospital literary magazine. Prior wanders through the nearby town and enters a pub where he meets Sarah, a munitions factory worker. They drink heavily and end the evening kissing in a cemetery. Prior walks Sarah home and agrees to meet the following Sunday. Unfortunately, he returns to Craiglockhart after curfew that night and is prohibited from leaving the hospital grounds for the next two weeks. As soon as his punishment is over, Prior visits Sarah, apologizes profusely for his absence, and takes her to the seaside. During a sudden storm, Sarah and Prior have sex underneath a thicket of thorns. Afterwards, Prior is overwhelmed by the emotional attachment he feels and purposely distances himself from Sarah. Dr. Rivers accedes to Prior's demands and uses hypnosis to recover his missing memories. Prior is then forced to relive the moment that rendered him mute. He is walking along a trench when an incoming shell kills the two men with whom he has just been speaking. As he shovels their gruesome remains into a bag, he finds an eye staring at him from beneath the duckboards. He picks it up and is holding it in the palm of his hand when he feels his jaw go numb. Once the spell of hypnosis is broken, Prior is furious that the memory is so mundane; he had seen many similarly gory scenes before that particular incident. Dr. Rivers explains that shell-shock is not usually the consequence of one single event, but the result of repeated traumatic incidents wearing a person down. Meanwhile, the stress of his work has run down Dr. Rivers. When he awakens one night with chest pain, his supervisor, Bryce, insists that he take three weeks of sick leave. Dr. Rivers visits his brother in the countryside, attending church, helping with the family chicken farm, and mulling over his relationship with his late father. Afterwards, he visits Henry Head, his friend from Cambridge, who offers him a prestigious post studying shell-shock in a London hospital. Dr. Rivers promises to consider it but is reticent to leave Craiglockhart. While he is still on leave, Dr. Rivers travels to visit Burns, who has been granted permanent home leave and is living in his parents' empty seaside cottage. Burns has repressed all of his memories of the war and Dr. Rivers is hesitant to make him remember, despite his firm belief in his methods. One night during a storm, Burns flees the house and hides in the cellar of a lighthouse that floods completely at high tide. Dr. Rivers finds Burns and saves him before the tide comes in, realizing that no military responsibility or code of honor can justify Burns's extreme anguish. Dr. Rivers discovers that Billy Prior has asthma after the young officer suffers a severe attack. Rivers forces Prior to see a specialist, despite his patient's protests. When the board reviews Prior's file, they grant Prior permanent home service as a result of his asthma. Prior is devastated that he will not have the opportunity to prove himself on the battlefield but is also relieved that he will no longer have to face imminent death. Later, he breaks into Sarah's room and they lie in bed together. Prior admits that he loves her and Sarah responds that she loves him as well. Wracked by guilt and haunted by the apparition of a dead friend from the war, Sassoon decides that he must return to France. His protest has failed, effectively neutered by his stay at Craiglockhart; if he cannot help end the war, Sassoon feels duty-bound to return to it. Yet the lieutenant's pacifism and thoughts about the war have only hardened. Dr. Rivers is confused but relieved by Sassoon's decision. Encouraged by Bryce, Dr. Rivers accepts the new position in London. The city has grown darker with the war and is oppressed by constant air raids. Dr. Rivers reluctantly accepts an invitation to visit, Dr. Yealland, a fellow psychologist, and witness his treatment methods. Dr. Yealland turns out to be a cruel and sadistic man who takes delight in shocking his patients into submission. He believes that all illnesses are physical and neglects the emotional state of his patients entirely. Horrified, Dr. Rivers returns home where he dreams that he is in Dr. Yealland's place, shoving an electrode and then a horse-bit into the mouth of a terrified man. After waking, Dr. Rivers realizes the man he was torturing was Sassoon. Dr. Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for Anderson and Sassoon's review boards. Anderson is granted an administrative position with the War Office, saving him from returning to the blood of the battlefield or a civilian medical practice. Sassoon is discharged to duty in France, despite his refusal to retract his statements about the war. Dr. Rivers and Sassoon exchange an awkward but warm farewell. Later that night, Dr. Rivers thinks about how much Sassoon has transformed his own opinion of the war. He concludes that no government who would sacrifice its children so wantonly deserves automatic allegiance."
Therese Raquin,"Emile Zola's short novel Therese Raquin traces the complete life's story of its title character: her childhood defined by confinement and resentment; her adulthood marked by passion and deception; and finally the murder, violence, and suicide of her last years. Orphaned at an early age, Therese was raised by her protective aunt, a shopkeeper named Mme Raquin. The young girl's only real companion was her sickly cousin Camille, a lazy young man adored by his mother. When Camille and Mme Raquin relocate to Paris, Therese follows along. And when Mme Raquin engineers a marriage between Therese and Camille, Therese blankly accepts, resigning herself to a future of boredom. Therese's life is turned upside-down by the appearance of Laurent, Camille's strong and independent friend. A man addicted to sensual pleasures, Laurent decides to take Therese as his lover. The young woman assents, and a vivifying, satisfying affair ensues between the emotional Therese and the hearty Laurent. When it becomes clear that this liaison cannot continue - since their secret meetings distracts from Laurent's office job - Laurent and Therese decide to murder Camille and marry. Together, Laurent, Therese, and Camille go on a boating excursion on the Seine river. Laurent chokes Camille and hurls him into the water, and stages this act of violence so that it looks like a freak accident. He executes all this with Therese's tacit consent. After the murder, Therese and Laurent bide their time for about a year and a half. But Laurent is increasingly haunted by his victim; in fact, he had seen Camille's bloated corpse in the Paris Morgue and fantasizes that the dead man is invading his apartment, his bed, and every aspect of his life. Therese is plagued by similar dark fantasies. The two decide to get married as quickly as possible to try to dispel the pull of Camille's ghost. They settle into the apartment where Mme Raquin lives, and succeed in concealing their deed from the old woman. Though Therese and Laurent had murdered Camille in order to be together, they soon find one another's company hateful. Their nerves are jangled, they are racked by insomnia, and visions of Camille's ghastly corpse haunt both of them constantly. Laurent tries to find solace in an old pastime - painting - but cannot shake his obsession with Camille. In the meantime, Mme Raquin has become increasingly immobilized, finally succumbing to complete paralysis. And once Mme Raquin is rendered completely helpless in this way, she makes a shocking discovery: that Therese and Laurent, whom she regarded as her own children, were in fact her son's murderers. Months pass, and Therese and Laurent attempt to exorcise Camille and escape one another's unbearable company in new ways: by indulging in tearful confessions; by scolding and beating each other; and by resorting to drink and adultery. None of these methods succeed. Finally, Laurent plans to murder Therese, and Therese decides to murder Laurent. These two, independent murder schemes are revealed at the same moment, and the revelation reduces Therese and Laurent to tears. At last, they feel at peace. The two drink together the poison that Laurent was preparing for Therese and they fall dead at the feet of Mme Raquin, who sits gloating over the morbid spectacle."
Sons and Lovers,"Meet Gertrude Morel, a vibrant and ambitious young woman who has some really great ideas. Unfortunately, in early-20th-century British society, women don't get many opportunities to discuss ideas. So, instead of talking, she goes to parties and entertains herself by trying to find out as much as she can about the other guests. You know, kind of like how we ride the bus with our sunglasses on just so we can stare at people. Anyway, one day, Gertrude comes across a man who's unlike anyone she's ever met. His name? Walter Morel.Walter is a young coal miner who loves to dance and sing without any of the inhibitions that govern Gertrude's prim and proper life. Lucky guys, those early-20th-century Brit boys. Compared to the women, at least--are we right? Anyway, it doesn't take long for Walter's zest for life to completely win Gertrude's heart. Surprise, surprise. Swoon, swoon. Big fat diamond. Next thing you know, Gertrude becomes Mrs. Morel. There's only one problem: Walter decides shortly after marrying that he doesn't want to be a teetotaler anymore, and starts drinking away all of their money. Oh yeah, and he kind of lied about ever having any money to begin with. Mrs. Morel quickly descends into a miserable life and has four children with Walter. Her first son, William, grows up to be an energetic and successful guy. Mrs. Morel is pretty up-front about the fact that she wants to use William to live out all her unfulfilled ambitions. Yikes. When William dies young, though, Mrs. Morel heaps all of these unfulfilled desires onto her next son, Paul. Then she gets really possessive of him. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. We guess. Paul is a quiet and artistic boy. As he grows up, he and his mother become inseparable. But then Paul falls in love with Miriam. Paul can't admit to this love openly, because his mom doesn't really like Miriam. She thinks Miriam is going to suck all of the energy out of Paul and make him average, when Paul should be going out and doing great things in the world. As the story continues, Paul actually starts feeling an attraction to Miriam's older, married friend, Clara Dawes. And yep, he ends up breaking things off with Miriam and getting with Clara. Kind of harsh, bro. But Paul can't commit to Clara either. There's some part of him that he's never willing to give to a woman... a woman who isn't his mother, anyway. He wants to connect with someone, but doesn't want to marry because it might interfere with his pursuit of individual greatness. This sounds like a pretty familiar narrative in some cultures--especially for men--don't you think? Sadly, Paul's mom gets sick and dies. Paul, consequently, spirals out of control, falling into a life of drinking and flirting with women he doesn't care about. During this time, Miriam asks him if they can get married, and he says no. Bad news bears abound. Paul sinks deeper and deeper into his dark hole of sadness. He thinks about committing suicide so he can be with his mother again, but instead he decides to forge ahead and try to live a good life...At the end of the novel, though, we simply don't know if he'll be able to live, or not. So we say: best of luck to you, buddy. You go on and chase your dreams."
The Hound of the Baskervilles,"This adventure concerns the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville, and the possibility that the heir to his fortune might be the object of murder. Before the novel begins, Sir Charles Baskerville had died suddenly, perhaps the victim of a ghostly hound believed to haunt his family because of an age-old curse. The Baskerville estate is located out in the remote moor of Devonshire. Holmes and Watson are introduced to the case by Dr. Mortimer, a friend of Sir Charles Baskerville. Mortimer believes that a hound has in fact killed Sir Charles, because he found a paw print near Sir Charles's corpse. He is worried that there may be some truth to the superstitious legend, which is detailed in an old manuscript, and thus approaches Holmes in hopes that the detective can protect Sir Henry, who is soon to arrive to claim the family estate and fortune. When Sir Henry arrives in London, he exhibits no fear of the old legend. Instead, he insists on leaving soon for Baskerville Hall. However, several strange things happen while he is in London: an anonymous letter arrives, warning him to stay away from the moor; two boots are stolen from his hotel, each from a different pair; and Holmes observes a bearded man following him around the city. Certain that something insidious is afoot, Holmes sends Watson to Devonshire, where he is to accompany and protect Sir Henry while Holmes wraps up some business in London. Upon his arrival in Baskerville Hall, Watson begins his detective work. He discovers several mysterious circumstances. There is an escaped convict, Selden, wandering the moor. Barrymore, the butler, frequently awakes in the middle of the night and shines a light from an empty room in the house. Mrs. Barrymore is constantly in tears. Watson also meets the Stapletons, a brother and sister who are friendly neighbors of the Baskerville estate. However, Miss Stapleton is clearly anxious, since she secretly warns Watson to leave the moor immediately, before learning he is not actually Sir Henry. Watson learns from Mr. Stapleton about the existence of Grimpen Mire, a part of the moor which is too dangerous to pass. On several occasions, he hears the frightening howl of a hound coming from this area of the moor. One night, Watson and Sir Henry follow Barrymore, and discover that he and his wife are secretly feeding Selden, who is actually Mrs. Barrymore's brother. Watson and Sir Henry try to capture Selden, but fail. However, that night, Watson sees a mysterious figure standing alone up in the hills. The next morning, the men promise Barrymore not to report Selden, and he in turn tells them how his wife found a letter that was sent to Sir Charles on the day he died. Apparently, the man was outside that night to meet a woman with the initials L.L. Watson investigates to discover that this woman is Laura Lyons, who lives in the nearby Coombe Tracey. He visits her to learn that Sir Charles was going to give her money to secure a divorce, but that she did not keep her appointment that night because someone else offered her the money. Watson then tries to track down the mysterious man on the moor, and discovers that it is actually Sherlock Holmes, who has been living secretly on the moor to observe the mystery from a distance. He explains that his open presence would have compromised his investigation. While there, Holmes has learned that Mr. Stapleton is in fact married to Miss Stapleton; they are not brother and sister, but have instead assumed fake identities. He believes Stapleton is responsible for Sir Charles's death, but he does not have the proof yet. Suddenly, Watson and Holmes hear the same cry Watson heard earlier, and they rush to find a corpse out on the moor. Though they initially believe it is Sir Henry's body - since the figure is dressed in the man's clothes - they soon discover it is actually Selden's corpse. He had clearly been fleeing something, and had fallen from a cliff in the process. As they debate what to do with the body, Stapleton arrives. Though surprised, he quickly recovers his composure and easily identifies Sherlock Holmes. Holmes accompanies Watson to Baskerville Hall, and has dinner with Sir Henry. During dinner, they learn that Stapleton had invited Sir Henry to dinner, and hence had been expecting him, not Selden, to be out on the moor that night. Selden was dressed in Sir Henry's clothes because Barrymore had given them to the convict. Holmes notices a portrait of Hugo Baskerville, and secretly indicates to Watson that the face bears a striking similarity to Stapleton's. He thereby realizes that Stapleton must be a Baskerville, who hopes to kill off the surviving family members so that he will inherit the fortune. However, Holmes does not tell Sir Henry the truth. Instead, he claims that he and Watson are returning to London, and instructs Sir Henry to join Stapleton for dinner the following night. Though it requires him walking alone across the moor, Sir Henry agrees. That night, Holmes, Watson, and the London policeman Lestrade - who joined Holmes via train - stake out Stapleton's house. Watson sneaks close to spy Stapleton dining alone with Sir Henry; Miss Stapleton is absent. A fog compromises visibility, so the party has to retreat a bit. It is from this vantage that they soon see Sir Henry stroll past, and then a savage hound, flames seemingly leaping from its mouth, fly after the man. They are able to kill it only with several shots, right before it is prepared to rip out Sir Henry's throat. Holmes studies the hound's corpse to discover that its mouth has been lined with phosphorus, thereby creating the image of flames, and its fur covered with a glitter. They try to pursue Stapleton, but only find Miss Stapleton, who has been tied up, gagged, and locked away in the house. She tells them that Stapleton had restrained her, and likely fled out into Grimpen Mire, which is where he kept the hound locked away. The next morning, they search Grimpen Mire, but find only Stapleton's boot. They assume he has died. They also find evidence of where he kept the hound, and that Stapleton had been feeding the beast with other animals. A month later, Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer embark on a trip around the world, so that Sir Henry can recover from his shock. One day, Watson questions Holmes about the case, and the detective provides all the missing pieces. Stapleton's actual name was Rodger Baskerville; he is the son of Sir Charles's youngest brother, who had long before moved to South America. After his father's death, Stapleton fled to England, changed his identity, and set out to construct a means to claim the Baskerville fortune. His wife had eventually tried to stop him, which is why he locked her away. The details provided, Holmes invites Watson to join him for dinner and a show."
Twelve Years a Slave,"Solomon Northup is a carpenter and also plays the violin. Two members of a circus company approach him and offer him a job as a violinist working for them. Solomon agreed and without telling his wife, he traveled to New York with them. However, when he wakes up he is bound and held captive as a slave. He proclaimed his status as a ""free man"" but as a result he was beaten. He is then taken to New Orleans where he meets a sympathizer to slaves, and he convinces him to send a letter to his family. Northup's first employer was William Ford who ran a lumber mill. He was treated badly and punished but his carpentry skills did come of great use. Northup was also leased to other slave owners, including Tibeats, who attempted to beat him and Solomon fought against him, which led to further punishment. His next employer was Edwin Epps, a unpleasant cotton planter who had a sadistic aura about him. Epps made use of Solomon's skill and often made him whip other slaves. Solomon then meets and befriends Samuel Bass, a white man who works on the plantation. He confides in him and states that he is actually a free man. Solomon sent letters to his family through Bass and his situation was made aware to a man names Parker who notified Henry Northup, a white lawyer and Solomon's friend. Henry then travels to the cotton plant in order to set Solomon free. He hires attorney, John Waddill to assist him in his quest. They were able to set Solomon free. When Solomon filed a lawsuit against the men who sold him, he lost. He then returns to his family after twelve years of imprisonment, as a free man."
The Last of the Mohicans,"Guided by the displaced Huron warrior Magua, four people -- Major Duncan Heyward, Psalmodist David Gamut, and Alice and Cora Munro -- strike through the wilderness forest for Fort William Henry, which is besieged by the French near Lake George. Led astray by Magua, they encounter the white woodsman Hawkeye and his two Mohican companions, Chingachgook and Uncas, whereupon the villainous Huron escapes. Traveling to the safety of the caves at Glenn's Falls, the party is attacked by Indians early the next morning. Running out of munitions, the three woodsmen escape downriver for help, but the others are captured and taken away by a splinter group of warriors headed by Magua. After a long journey, the Huron coldly proposes to Cora, whose refusal brings an attack upon the captives, who are saved by the sudden arrival of the three woodsmen. All the Indians are killed except Magua, who gets away again. Leading the party of protagonists through narrow escapes from Indians and then besieging Frenchmen, Hawkeye brings them to a mountainside vantage point overlooking the fort. During the trip, a quiet interest develops between the young Uncas and the brunette Cora, while Heyward shows a deference toward Alice. With difficulty finding their way through the heavy morning mists and the omnipresent French, the seven, hotly pursued, finally reach the fort, where Commander Munro recognizes the voice of his daughter Alice and opens a sally-port for them. Heyward leads a repulse of the pursuing Frenchmen. With the passage of days, a parley is held, and, since General Webb is sending no help, Munro agrees to surrender. Meanwhile, Heyward learns that Cora's darkened aspect lies not only in a brooding nature but also in the fact that she is part black. During the planned withdrawal of the English forces, the Indians begin a bloody massacre, and Magua once again escapes with the two girls and Gamut. Three days later, the three woodsmen, Munro, and Heyward go north of the lake and across the country in pursuit. When Uncas is captured by the Hurons, Hawkeye effects his escape and Alice's through disguise and all head for the Delaware village where Cora is held captive. Magua follows and demands his prisoners. Uncas reveals himself as a chief to the patriarch Tamenund, and Magua is allowed his only rightful prisoner, Cora, though the protagonists and the Delawares vow to follow and regain her freedom. Coming out of hiding in a beaver pond, Chingachgook and Munro join the ensuing battle, in which the Hurons are defeated. Nonetheless, Magua and two warriors escape with Cora through the nearby caves and up a mountainside. Finally cornered by Hawkeye, Heyward, Gamut, and Uncas, the Hurons give defiance and in the fighting Cora, Uncas, and Magua are killed. The next day is one of mourning for the Delawares. Cora and Uncas are buried side by side, and all the white characters except Hawkeye leave. When Chingachgook states that he is now alone, Hawkeye grasps his hand and declares that such is not so. At the same time, Tamenund sadly comments upon the worsening historic plight of the American Indians and particularly upon the tragically accomplished demise of the wise and noble race of Mohicans."
House of Mirth,"Lily Bart, the main character, is standing on a railway platform waiting for a train when Lawrence Selden sees her. He decides to see if she will greet him, and when she does he learns that she has missed her train to go to the Trenor's house. He takes a walk with her and they end up going into his apartment to enjoy some tea and a smoke. Upon leaving Selden's house, Lily encounters a Mr. Rosedale, a wealthy man who is not yet a member of the elite New York society. He is suspicious of her being in a bachelor's house and she runs into a cab and catches her train without explaining what she was doing. On the train Lily encounters Percy Gryce, one of the very wealthy bachelors that she is hoping to marry. Lily causes them to meet ""accidentally"" and establishes a conversation that is interrupted when a Mrs. Dorset arrives on the train. They all end up at the Trenor's house for an extended party, and while there, Lily is able to spend time with Mr. Gryce. It appears as if they will eventually get married. The arrival of Selden ruins her plans, however, and when Lily takes an afternoon walk with Selden, a jealous Mrs. Dorset goes to Gryce and tells him all the bad things she has ever heard about Lily. Mrs. Trenor, who was helping match Lily and Mr. Gryce, is furious with the way Lily ruined her chances with him. Lily accepts the rebuke and goes to pick up Mr. Trenor from the train station. On the way home she asks him for money, and he agrees to ""invest"" on her behalf. She soon receives a check for one thousand. Several weeks later Lily attends the wedding of her cousin Jack Stepney and Gwen Van Osburgh. At the wedding Mr. Trenor gives her another check for four thousand but makes her take some time to speak to Mr. Rosedale in return. In her efforts to escape Mr. Rosedale, Lily encounters Mrs. Van Osburgh who ""secretly"" tells her that Mr. Gryce is engaged to her daughter Evie. While staying at her aunt's house, Lily receives a visit from a charwoman who has letters written by Mrs. Dorset to Selden which clearly indicate an affair. Lily purchases the letters, planning to use them to get back at Bertha for ruining her chances with Percy Gryce. Rosedale also stops by one day and invites her to join him at the opera, forcing her to go by indicating he knows about her financial relationship with Mr. Trenor. She attends the opera and Mr. Trenor tries to demand to see more of her in return for the money he has given her, but Lily refuses his demands. Lily accidentally offends Grace Stepney, a good friend of Mrs. Peniston. Grace retaliates by telling Mrs. Peniston that Lily has been gambling at bridge and thereby incurred debts. She also hints that Lily may be spending time with married men, causing Mrs. Peniston to be shocked by disbelief. The Wellington Brys, a rich family trying to enter the upper crust society, hold a coming out party that includes a mini play where some of the ladies pretend to be in various portraits. Lily puts herself in a Reynolds and is so beautiful that Selden wants to marry her when he sees her. He finds Lily and takes her to the garden where they share a kiss before she runs away from him. The next day she has two invitations, one from Mrs. Trenor and one from Selden. She accepts both and that night goes to the Trenor's house. Gus Trenor is there and starts trying to make her give him sexual favors for the money he lent her. She protests and appeals to his sense of being a gentleman, thereby making him stop. She leaves the house and goes to Gerty Farish's where she tells Gerty what happened to her. Unfortunately, Selden was standing outside the Trenor's house when Lily leaves it and assumes that she is having an affair with him. The next day Lily realizes she is over nine thousand dollars in debt to Mr. Trenor. She appeals to her aunt and even admits to gambling at cards, but Mrs. Peniston refuses to hear her out and also will not pay her debts. Instead of Selden showing up, Rosedale arrives and asks her to marry him. Lily, still thinking that Selden will marry her, turns him down. The second half of the novel starts with Lily having spent several months with the Dorsets on their yacht. They end up in Monte Carlo along with Selden and several other of the New York elite. It turns out Lily was on the yacht in order to distract Mr. Dorset so that his wife could have an affair with a young poet named Ned Silverton. While in Monte Carlo, Mr. Dorset discovers what has happened and Lily is caught in the middle. Selden convinces Mr. Dorset to do nothing, but later the next evening Mrs. Dorset kicks Lily off of the yacht, thereby starting her social rejection. Lily returns to New York after learning that her aunt has died and goes to hear the will being read. Instead of Lily inheriting the estate, it goes to Grace Stepney, and Lily only gets about ten thousand, meaning that she can barely pay off Gus Trenor. The other women present immediately start to snub Lily. Carrie Fisher takes pity on her and arranges for Lily to work for the Gormers, a family that is trying to make their name in society one level lower than what Lily is used to. Carrie also tells Lily that she needs to marry immediately and advises Lily to either marry George Dorset or Mr. Rosedale. She rejects Mr. Dorset even after meeting with him twice and instead chooses Rosedale. When Rosedale tells her that he will only marry her after she uses the letters she purchased and renews her friendship with Mrs. Dorset, Lily rejects him as well. Carrie Fisher again helps her out and sets her up with Mrs. Norma Hatch, a social climber one level below the Gormers. Lily realizes too late that her own reputation is suffering by association and moves out. Selden had tried to help her but only caused her to remain there longer. She next gets a job in a hat factory but is so bad at it that she soon is taking days off, claiming to be sick. Rosedale encounters her one day and walks her home. Seeing how poorly she is living, he renews his offer to her, provided she use the letters and get back at Bertha Dorset. Lily finally decides to do what Rosedale has suggested and takes the letters. However, she passes Selden's house on the way to the Dorsets and stops there first. After some tea and a terribly sentimental episode, Lily burns the letters in his fireplace and hurries out of his apartment. She meets a woman on the streets who recognizes her, a woman whom she once gave charity money to. The woman makes Lily come home with her and warm up. When Lily returns to her boarding house, she lays out her dresses and looks at them, remembering all the occasions she used them. After putting them away, her maid hands her a letter containing the ten thousand dollar check with her inheritance. Lily writes a check to Gus Trenor to pay off her debts and puts it by her bedside. She then takes chloral, a type of sleeping tablet, in order to fall asleep. However, she takes more than she should and dies as a result. Selden arrives at her place the next morning, desperate to see her and clear things up between them. He is too late, however, and enters her room along with Gerty Farish to find her dead body on the bed. Gerty leaves and Selden looks around the room, recovering a note he had sent to her months before. He also sees the note to Trenor and the checkbook balance, and realizes that Lily had been in debt to Trenor. Selden is left at the end not knowing what Lily had really been doing with Trenor, but blaming life for having kept them apart."
The Deerslayer,"Natty Bumppo and Hurry Harry, about the year 1740, journey toward Otsego Lake in upstate New York. Although they are not always in agreement, the two men realize the need of each other's protection in case of attack from the Indians . Natty, or Deerslayer, is on his ""first warpath,"" as the novel is subtitled, because he has not yet been in combat with another man nor been forced to kill a human being; in this novel, he will be forced to kill. The two travelers, finding Muskrat Castle deserted, seek Tom Hotter and his two daughters, Judith and Hetty, in the trapper's other home, the ark. Hurry Harry, hoping to marry Judith, is treated coldly by her when the two men locate the ark, but Deerslayer is greeted warmly. Hetty is equally friendly to Deerslayer and to Hurry Harry. Suspicious at first of Deerslayer, Tom Hutter, or Floating Tom, realizes that the newcomer will be a valuable ally in case of Indian attack. As the ark is maneuvered away from shore to the open lake, some Mingos try to board the vessel; but Deerslayer proves his worth by repulsing the invasion. The three men decide to reclaim the canoes hidden by Tom Hutter along the shores of Glimmerglass. Having succeeded in this mission for their protection and defense, Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry scheme to land in the dark, attack the sleeping Mingo women and children, and get scalps for the bounties. Although Deerslayer refuses to join this expedition, he waits offshore in a canoe for the return of Hurry Harry and Floating Tom. The Mingos are not so easily deceived, and the two white men are captured. Unable to help the prisoners, Deerslayer determines to secure the canoes first and to return to the ark where the girls are waiting. One canoe drifts to the shore, and Deerslayer, trying to recover the boat, is met by a Mingo who also claims the canoe. Thinking that he has persuaded the Indian of the true ownership of the boat, Deerslayer turns away. In time, Deerslayer sees the Mingo preparing to shoot, and he fatally wounds the attacking Indian. Deerslayer, having experienced his ""first warpath,"" treats his dying opponent honorably by not taking his scalp and by arranging him comfortably. The Mingos, recognizing in Natty Bumppo a great warrior, call him by a new nickname -- Hawkeye. At the ark, Deerslayer prepares to meet his friend Chingachgook, a chief of the Delaware nation. The rendezvous is perilous because the Mingos are pursuing Chingachgook. He jumps aboard the ark and barely escapes. While the friends rejoice in their reunion, Hetty surprises everyone by her decision to leave alone in a canoe, go to the Indians and try to convince the savages to release the two prisoners. Although Deerslayer tries to block her path with another canoe, Hetty eludes him and refuses to listen to his warnings. Hetty, stumbling through the woods, meets Hist, who has been abducted by a renegade Delaware and brought to the Mingo camp. Hist is in love with Chingachgook and explains to Hetty that the Delaware chief and Deerslayer have met at Glimmerglass to rescue her. Although the Mingos refuse to listen to Hetty's pleas to release Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry, they do not harm the girl because they respect as blessed by divine protection a person of limited intelligence and simple-mindedness, such as Hetty. Deerslayer and Judith open Tom Hutter's chest to find any items they can use as ransom for the two white men. The three exiles on the ark, intent on their investigation of the chest, are startled by the appearance of a Mingo who serves as a guide for the returning Hetty. Deerslayer shows some ivory chess pieces to the Indian who eagerly goes back to the Mingo camp with this news of a possible exchange of the pawns for the prisoners. After hard bargaining, Rivenoak, the Mingo chief who has approached the ark, accepts the ivory rooks, and Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry are set free. Learning nothing from their close call with death, the two men plot another raid for scalps on the Indian camp. They discover, however, that the Indians have moved camp, spoiling their plans. Setting out to rescue Hist, Deerslayer and Chingachgook are dismayed to find that the new Mingo camp is at the place where the Indian girl told Hetty she would be waiting. Despite the increased danger, Deerslayer and Chingachgook plot to save Hist. In the ensuing action, Deerslayer is able to shove the canoe with Chingachgook and Hist beyond range of the Mingos, but he is pursued by the Indians and captured. Hetty is sent by Judith to the Mingos, but they refuse to bargain for such an important prisoner. Judith and Hetty, after the latter's return from her unsuccessful mission to ransom Deerslayer, travel in their canoe around Glimmerglass in search of the ark. A shot fired by Hurry Harry from the ark accidentally kills an Indian maiden who was meeting her lover on the shore. On the ark, the four refugees go to Muskrat Castle where the white men, ignoring the warnings of their two Indian companions about a possible ambush, enter fearlessly. The Mingos, hiding in the castle, attack, subdue, and tie up Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry. Chingachgook and Hist, helpless onlookers on the ark, maneuver the boat out of range; and Hurry Harry quickly rolls off the castle's platform into the lake where he is pulled to safety. The Mingos at first pursue the ark in a canoe, but they see a better target: Judith and Hetty in another canoe. After a chase which the Mingos almost win, one of the Indians breaks a paddle and they give up the pursuit. When the two girls go to Muskrat Castle, they find that Tom Hutter, scalped by the Mingos, is close to death. After confessing that he is not Judith and Hetty's father, Tom Hutter dies and is buried in Glimmerglass, close to the watery grave of his wife, the girls' mother. Deerslayer, released temporarily by the Mingos, appears and announces the terms of surrender from the Indians: Chingachgook is to leave in safety, the three girls are to live with the tribe. The offers are quickly rejected to Deerslayer's joy. Hurry Harry, rejected for the last time by Judith, is taken ashore by Deerslayer with the plea that he should try to reach the garrison of soldiers nearby. Deerslayer and Judith open Tom Hutter's chest on the ark, and letters confirm that he was a pirate. After endeavoring to win Deerslayer's love with her frank admission of love for him, Judith realizes that he will not sacrifice his code and his honor and that he will return to the Indian camp for torture and death. Deerslayer bids farewell on the following morning to his friends and gives them his final counsel. Chingachgook and he engage in a shooting match with Killdeer, Tom Hutter's rifle given by Judith to Deerslayer, and, after Deerslayer's death, to Chingachgook. The Mingos are surprised by his honorable return to his sentence of condemnation. Rivenoak, the chief, asks Deerslayer to join the tribe, but is refused. Deerslayer also refuses to marry the widow of the Mingo he killed on his ""first warpath."" The trial begins with the throwing of knives and tomahawks to unnerve Deerslayer; but he succeeds in seizing one tomahawk, hurling it back at his assailant, and making his escape. Recaptured by the Mingos because the current brought his canoe back to shore, Deerslayer is now tortured by rifle shots fired close to him at the stake and by a fire built at his feet. Judith appears elegantly dressed, claims she is an important lady with soldiers, and demands Deerslayer's release. Hetty, confused by the events, tells Rivenoak Judith's true identity. Chingachgook and Hist appear individually to challenge the Mingos, but they likewise fail. With all their enemies in hand, the Mingos are triumphant until soldiers from the garrison, guided by Hurry Harry and the shots fired by Deerslayer and Chingachgook on the ark, surprise the Indians and kill most of them. Hetty has been mortally wounded, and her death saddens all the survivors. After a last plea to Deerslayer to marry her, Judith goes back to the garrison with the soldiers. Deerslayer, Chingachgook, and Hist return to the Delaware territory. Fifteen years later, Deerslayer and Chingachgook return to Glimmerglass with the latter's son, Uncas, and contemplate the great adventure."
The Good Soldier,"The Good Soldier opens with John Dowell, the narrator, informing the reader that ""this is the saddest story ever heard."" His story, he explains will be about the nine-year acquaintance that he and his wife Florence had with another couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Because this novel is comprised of Dowell's thoughts as he writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Dowell's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts. In Part I of The Good Soldier, Dowell explains the background of the four protagonists. He and Florence are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Edward and Leonora are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Dowell sees similarities between the two couples. Both Dowell's wife, Florence, and Edward Ashburnham are ""heart patients."" The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both ""invalids"" come to improve their health. The four strike up a friendship. Dowell describes Edward as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Dowell goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Florence is discussing the Protest, Leonora realizes Florence and Edward will have an affair. Dowell is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Dowell compares their friendship to a minuet, and to ""an extraordinarily safe castle,"" but then he bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over. Edward has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Ashburnhams have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La Dolciquita, Edward brought the Ashburnhams into deep debt, and Leonora took complete control of all his money and land. The Ashburnhams have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Leonora feels she has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Dowells, Leonora sees Maisie Maidan coming out of her husband's bedroom and she assumes they are having an affair. She boxes Mrs. Maidan's ears, and Florence sees this act of violence. Leonora, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Florence to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends. Part I ends with Mrs. Maidan's death. Now that Florence has started an affair with Edward, Mrs. Maidan overhears them talking about her, and finds out that Leonora has brought her along so that she may be a ""safe"" mistress for Edward. Mrs. Maidan is appalled and dies; unlike Florence and Edward, she suffers from a real heart condition. Leonora lives with the guilt over this death. In Part II, Dowell explains Florence's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Edward Ashburnham's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Dowell and Florence's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Florence's aunts, the Misses Hurlbird, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Florence feigned a heart condition, and her pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Dowell and Florence lived in Paris, Florence has an affair with a low-class artist named Jimmy, but Dowell knows nothing about it. Dowell's own marriage to Florence has remained unconsummated for thirteen years. After Florence's nine-year affair with Edward, she plans to divorce Dowell and marry Edward. But one night, August 4, 1913, Florence sees Edward in the park alone at night with his young ward, Nancy. She grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Dowell about Florence's indecent relationship with Jimmy many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Florence's dead body; she has poisoned herself. Part III opens with Dowell considering marriage to Nancy, the Ashburnhams"" young ward. But Edward, too, is in love with her. Nancy, who has recently left convent school, admires her uncle immensely for his heroic deeds and she assumes he and Leonora have a healthy marriage; she is not in love with him in the same way. After Florence's death, Leonora, Edward, and Nancy all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Leonora has a nervous breakdown, since she surmises that Edward is in love with Nancy. In this section, Dowell narrates the entire history of Edward and Leonora's marriage. Through all his affairs, Leonora always hoped that Edward would return to her and love her again. But when Edward began his affair with Florence, Leonora's love died. In Part IV, Leonora realizes that Nancy is safe from Edward. She sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her husband possesses will keep him from starting an affair with Nancy. She has a breakdown and tells Nancy what a terrible husband Edward is. Nancy's ideals are crushed, and her eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Dowell says that together, Leonora and Nancy begin to slowly torture of Edward. He suffers greatly and plans for Nancy to travel to India to live with her father. She sends a telegram from India saying she is having a good time. Edward is crushed; all he desires is to have her worship him from afar. Edward commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife. Leonora remarries a ""perfectly normal"" man named Rodney Bayham and they have a child. Nancy goes mad; the only word she can say is ""shuttlecock."" Dowell buys Branshaw Manor and becomes Nancy's permanent caretaker."
The New Testament,"The New Testament is a collection of twenty-seven books centered on the figure of Jesus of Nazareth. Each of these books has its own author, context, theme, and persuasive purpose. Combined, they comprise one of history's most abundant, diverse, complex, and fascinating texts. The books of the New Testament are traditionally divided into three categories: the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the synoptic--meaning ""at one look""--Gospels because each one tells a similar story, differing only in some additions, special emphases, and particular omissions according to the interests of the author and the message the text is trying to convey. Each of the synoptic Gospels tells the story of Jesus of Nazareth, including his ministry, gathering of disciples, trial, crucifixion, and, in the case of Matthew and Luke, his resurrection. John is also a Gospel, though it is not placed with the synoptic Gospels because his story is so different. Rather than recording many of the facts about Jesus's life, the Gospel according to John focuses on the mystery and identity of Jesus as the Son of God. Acts of the Apostles follows John, although it was intended to be the second volume of a single unit beginning with Luke. The same author wrote Luke and Acts consecutively, and while Luke is a Gospel about Jesus, Acts picks up the story at the resurrection, when the early disciples are commissioned to witness to the world. Acts is a chronological history of the first church of Christ. The twenty-one books following Acts are epistles, or letters, written from church leaders to churches in various parts of the world. The first fourteen of these letters are called the ""Epistles of Paul"" and are letters that tradition has accorded to St. Paul in his correspondence with the earliest churches in the first and second century. Historians are fairly certain that Paul himself, Christianity's first theologian and successful missionary, indisputably composed seven of the letters, and possibly could have written seven others. The seven letters following the Epistles of Paul are called the Catholic Epistles, because they are addressed to the church as a whole rather than to particular church communities. These letters identify as their authors original apostles, biological brothers of Jesus, and John the Evangelist, although it is thought that they were actually written by students or followers of these early church luminaries. The first of the Catholic Epistles is the Letter of James, attributed to James, the brother of Jesus and leader of the Christian church in Jerusalem. Next are the First and Second Letters of Peter, which identify themselves as letters from the apostle Peter. The First, Second, and Third Letters of John attribute their authorship to John the Evangelist, and the Letter of Jude attributes itself to Jude, the brother of James, who is elsewhere identified as one of Jesus's brothers. The last book in the New Testament is the Revelation to John, or Book of Revelation, the New Testament's only piece of literature in the apocalyptic genre. It describes a vision by a leader of a church community in Asia Minor living under the persecution of the Roman Empire."
O Pioneers,"On the streets of a small windswept town in Hanover, Nebraska, five-year-old Emil Bergson cries because his kitten has been chased up a telegraph pole. His sister Alexandra fetches their friend Carl Linstrum to rescue the cat. Carl happily and handily retrieves the kitten and they send Emil into the general store to warm up. Alexandra tells Carl that their father is dying and she doesn't know what they will do. They fetch Emil, who is playing with a little Bohemian girl, Marie, and Carl drives their cart as far as his homestead. That night John Bergson tells his older children, Alexandra, Lou and Oscar, that he wishes them all to work together to keep the farm and prosper, but he is leaving Alexandra in charge, for she is the oldest and best knows what to do. Six months later, Alexandra, Oscar, Lou and Emil invite Carl to come with them to visit crazy Ivar. They are going to buy a hammock and see his pond. Emil is fascinated by Ivar's pond, which attracts many rare birds, but Alexandra also wants to ask his advice about their pigs. She is worried, because many of the neighbors' are dying, but Oscar and Lou scoff at Ivar's idiosyncratic advice. She ignores them and plans to follow it anyway. For three years the farm prospers, but then the land suffers three years of drought. During the second summer, Carl Linstrum's family decides to move away, for they cannot survive as farmers. Alexandra is very unhappy to lose her only friend, but she understands. The boys desperately want to sell up, but Alexandra convinces them to buy up as much as they possibly can instead, convinced that the land is valueable. Ten years later the Divide has become a flourishing town, and Alexandra's farm is the most successful of all. Emil and Marie have grown close. The two friends chat and tease each other happily as Emily finishes mowing a few plots that needed touching up. They discuss a friend's wedding, and Marie reminds Emil that he must dance with other girls besides her, if her husband, Frank, lets her go at all. At home Emil finds Alexandra at dinner with her workmen and old Ivar, who Alexandra took in after he lost his lands. They discuss their new grain silo and agree they must give it a good try, even if Lou disparages it. After dinner Ivar comes to Alexandra and confides that he is afraid the townspeople are going to force her to put him in the asylum. She lets him tell her his troubles and assures him sternly that she does not think he belongs in the asylum, so he need not concern himself with other people's foolish ideas. Carl Linstrum returns for a visit; Alexandra welcomes him while her brothers are stand-offish and suspicious. He is seeking gold in Alaska and plans to stay only a short while, but he re-bonds with Alexandra quickly. They visit Carl's old home together, now owned by Frank and Marie, and the visit does not go well due to Frank's peevishness. During his visit Carl also notices that Emil and Marie have a close friendship--perhaps dangerously close--but he is distracted from warning Alexandra because her brothers suddenly insist that he leave. They feel that he is trying to marry Alexandra for her money and land. This issue results in Alexandra's estrangement from her brothers. Carl leaves for Alaska and Emil, perhaps escaping from his passion for Marie, determines to leave for Mexico City. We rejoin the narrative in the middle of winter, a harsh season on the Divide. Despite Alexandra's continued quarrel with her brothers, she visits with her mother-in-law Mrs. Lee and Marie. Emil is working in Mexico City and Marie shows a great interest in him. She also vaguely expresses the unhappiness of her marriage with Frank, but alexandra prefers to ignore such emotional difficulties rather than engage them. Emil returns from Mexico he goes with Alexandra to a costme party at the French church. Everyone dresses up, he in the Mexican fashion, Marie as an old Bohemian fortune-teller. Marie is very happy to see him, as is his good friend Amedee, who has a newborn son. During a prank, Emil steals a kiss from Marie. In the confusion that follows, he tells her that he will leave her alone if she admits that she loves him. She does. Emil plans to take a law degree in Ann Arbor rather than remain near the temptation of Marie. As he is saying goodbye to Amedee, however, his good friend suddenly succumbs to appendicitis. Early the next morning Amedee dies; his funeral competes with a large confirmation ceremony and though Amedee was well-liked it's clear that life on the harsh Divide must go on. The death and the ensuing reflection convince Emil to seize his moment with Marie, no matter what the consequences. Emil rides to Marie's, ostensibly to say goodbye, and finds her asleep in the orchard. Later that evening Frank Shabata returns to find Emil's horse in the barn. Drunk and angry, Frank searches for Marie and Emil with a gun. He finds them in the orchard and half-consciously shoots them both. After the shooting Frank flees, only to give himself up later. Ivar discovers the bodies the next morning and tells Alexandra. Weeks later, Alexandra is distraught and confused by Marie and Emil's affair. She cannot forgive Marie for betraying her husband and shows strange sympathy for Frank. She visits Frank in jail and tells him that she's going to solicit the governor for a pardon. Carl returns from Alaska during her visit, having read about the double murder in a newspaper. He tries to help Alexandra understand how Marie and Emil could have behaved so foolishly and caused such a terrible situation. He asks Alexandra if he may stay the winter, and suggests that she come to Alaska with him in the Spring. They both decide to marry despite her brothers' objections. Alexandra tells Carl she is certain they will be happy, for their marriage will be based on friendship rather than more treacherous emotions."
The Mill on the Floss,"The Mill on the Floss opens with the unnamed narrator dreaming of Dorlcote Mill as she or he knew it years ago. At that time, Mr. Tulliver, owner of the mill and its farm, has decided to send his son, Tom, away to school so that he can become something more than a miller and farmer. When Tom gets home for the summer, he learns that his younger sister Maggie forgot to feed his rabbits and they have all died, so he is furious with her. Maggie is a very bright girl with good intentions and a strong desire to please her brother, so this devastates her. As will happen frequently throughout their lives, Tom coldly holds her carelessness against her for a little while before forgiving her. Tom's schooling at Mr. Stelling's begins. Tom finds the lessons largely unpleasant, as he is the only pupil and it is the kind of learning that he finds the most difficult. After the Christmas holiday, though, Philip Wakem joins him at King's Lorton to learn from Mr. Stelling. Philip is the son of Mr. Wakem, a lawyer whom Mr. Tulliver detests, so Tom is prepared to dislike him. Tom is also disturbed by Philip's physical deformity. Philip is overly sensitive but an apt pupil, so he also has a problem with the brutish miller's son. The two reach a wary peace, however, especially when Maggie comes to visit, as Philip is greatly impressed with her intelligence and kind nature. Two years later, Maggie goes away to school with her cousin Lucy, but is called home when Mr. Tulliver has lost his lawsuit against Mr. Pivart, a neighboring farmer represented by Mr. Wakem. The loss of the suit combined with his legal fees means he will lose the mill and be completely bankrupt. Right before Maggie's return, he learns that the mortgage on the farm has fallen into Mr. Wakem's hands, and this news on top of everything else causes him to lose his senses. Maggie goes to Mr. Stelling's to deliver the news to Tom, who comes home with her. There they find that Mr. Tulliver recognizes only Maggie, and a bailiff has come to sell off all of their household goods and furniture, which Mr. Tulliver had used as a security against one of his loans. Mrs. Tulliver turns to her sisters - Mrs. Pullet, Deane and Glegg - for help, but they are more interested in making their moral superiority known, and they only buy the goods that they would want anyway. Tom goes to his uncle Deane for advice on starting out in business so that he can help his family. Mr. Deane is somewhat discouraging, but he eventually finds Tom a starting position at Guest & Co., Mr. Deane's employer, and sets him up with lessons in bookkeeping. Mrs. Tulliver goes to see Mr. Wakem to try to discourage him from buying the mill when it comes up at auction, but she inadvertently convinces him to do just that. Mr. Tulliver has been slowly improving, and when they tell him that Mr. Wakem now owns the mill and is willing to keep him on as manager, he agrees to do so even though he despises the idea of working under Mr. Wakem, since he believes he owes it to his wife, and he doesn't want to make his family have to move. Mr. Tulliver's only focus now is on saving enough money to repay all of his remaining outstanding debts. Tom and Mrs. Tulliver agree this is the honorable thing to do, so Tom gives all of his earnings from his new job to this cause, and Mrs. Tulliver does everything she can to economize. Bob Jakin gives Maggie a pile of books as a gift, among which is a spiritual treatise which recommends self-renunciation as the path to peace. Maggie becomes convinced this is the only way she will be happy, but she goes at it with an egotistical zeal which is against the true nature of the renunciation. Bob Jakin offers Tom an investment opportunity that he takes with the help of Mr. and Mrs. Glegg, and he manages to quickly multiply his savings. Meanwhile, Philip Wakem meets Maggie on one of her walks, and pleads with her to meet with him regularly, secretly. She eventually agrees, and they do so for almost a year. Philip finally tells Maggie that he is in love with her, and she tells him that she can't imagine loving anyone more than she does him, but she could never marry him and risk hurting her father and brother so deeply. Tom figures out that Maggie has been meeting Philip and tells her that if she ever sees or communicates with Philip again without Tom's permission, he will tell their father all about it, which will probably cause him to lose his sanity again. She accepts his terms, and Tom follows her to her next meeting with Philip. Tom is very cruel to him, and Maggie tells Philip she must end their friendship. Tom manages to earn enough money with his investments to pay back all of Mr. Tulliver's debt. Mr. Tulliver is joyous, and decides to quit working for Mr. Wakem, but when he runs into him and tells him this, his anger gets the best of him and he ends up attacking Mr. Wakem with a horsewhip. This brings on a stroke of some sort for Mr. Tulliver, and he dies soon after, telling Tom that he should work to buy the mill back, and he should never forgive the Wakems. Two years later, Maggie returns to St. Ogg's to stay with her cousin Lucy Deane after having worked at a school since her father's death. When Maggie learns of Lucy's friendship with Philip Wakem, she tells Lucy about her prior, forbidden relationship with him; Lucy begins to scheme ways to get the pair together. Maggie meets Stephen Guest, who has been courting Lucy, and immediately is very attracted to him, and he to her. Though they both try to ignore their feelings, eventually they are overwhelmed by them, and so Maggie goes to visit her aunt Moss to get away for a little. Stephen comes to her there and tells her that he loves her and that they have to be together. Though Maggie is tempted, she insists that she could never be happy with him because of the guilt she would feel about Lucy and Philip. When Maggie returns to St. Ogg's, Lucy, trying to solidify the relationship between Maggie and Philip, arranges for them to be alone on a boat ride. Philip, though, is depressed because he has realized Maggie and Stephen have feelings for one another, so he arranges to have Stephen take his place, unintentionally leading to Stephen and Maggie being alone in the boat together. Stephen convinces Maggie to elope with him, so they leave the rowboat for a steamship to York. The next morning, however, when they dock, Maggie realizes she can't allow herself to get her happiness out of Philip and Lucy's hurt, so she tells Stephen she can't marry him after all, and heads back to St. Ogg's. When Maggie returns to St. Ogg's five days later, everyone believes the worst of her, including Tom, who refuses to offer her a home with him. Mrs. Tulliver supports her, though, and together they lodge at childhood friend Bob Jakin's. A letter comes from Stephen to his father, absolving Maggie of guilt, but the damage to her reputation has been done. The town's clergyman, Dr. Kenn, tries to help her and even gives her a job as governess to his children, but when rumors start to swirl about the two of them, he tells her it would be best if she moved to another town altogether. Lucy, who has been unwell since the shock of Maggie and Stephen running off together, sneaks out one night to visit Maggie and tells her that once she is well again, she will come see her often. Maggie gets two letters, one from Philip telling her he doesn't blame her and wishes her to feel no guilt for his sake, and one from Stephen pleading with her to marry him. She resolves to turn him down for good. She realizes the house is flooding and, after waking Bob and his family, gets into a boat to get to Dorlcote Mill. Mrs. Tulliver is safely out of town, but Tom is there and gets into the boat with her. They have a moment of unspoken resolution, but a large piece of debris comes right into their path and drowns them. Everyone else survives the flood and the siblings are buried next to one another."
Treasure Island,"The setting of this story is described by young Jim Hawkins as the book begins: ""Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up lodging under our roof."" Gravely ill, Billy Bones resides at the Admiral Benbow for ""many months."" The brown old seaman' strikes fear into patrons' hearts as he consumes dangerous quantities of rum and sings an old sea song: ""Fifteen men on the dead man's chest - Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest - Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum."" Bones warns Jim to keep his weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg' and relates tales of piracy and other foul deeds while he was pirate. One evening, while he is guzzling rum, he is reprimanded by Dr. Livesey, who has arrived to examine Jim's dying father. A short time later, Black Dog, a mysterious ""tallowy creature,"" frightens Jim into revealing the whereabouts of Bones. Following a brief sword duel with the ""Dog,"" Blind Pew visits the old seaman, another of his old shipmates, who delivers the ""black spot,"" a death summons used by pirates. Soon after, Bones succumbs to a stroke and Jim and his mother run to a nearby village, where the inhabitants refuse to help them. Just before the pirates reach the inn, Jim removes a key from the corpse and grabs an oilskin packet from the captain's old sea chest. While the pirates frantically sack Bones' belongings in the inn, Jim and his mother hide under a nearby bridge. Unable to find ""Flint's fist,' the pirates escape, leaving Pew behind to be fatally trampled by horsemen from the village, who have finally decided to come to Jim and his mother's aid. At the home of Squire Trelawney, Jim delivers the packet to Dr. Livesey. ""This is the black-hearted hound's account book,"" the squire observes after the oilskin is removed. Passing over figures and course headings, the men turn to a second enclosure, a map of Captain John Flint's treasure island. Trelaweny experiences an uncontrollable fit of excitement, vows to secure the best ship in England, and commands Livesey and Jim to accompany him on a treasure-hunting voyage. Several weeks later, Trelawney hires Long John silver, a one-legged seaman and cook, and a salty band of other sailors. At Bristol, the crew weighs anchor and the Hispanolia begins its journey. Becoming acquainted with the charismatic sea cook, who totes a pet parrot named ""Captain Flint,"" Jim is surprised when, hiding in an apple barrel on deck, he overhears Silver conspiring with crewmates Israel Hands and the young Dick to take the ship once the treasure is aboard. After land is sighted, a battle ensues between Captain Smollett's royal forces and Silver's swarthy pirates. Jim escapes ashore and falls in with Ben Gunn, an unfortunate seaman who was marooned by Captain Flint three years earlier. Treading the boundary between the opposing camps, Jim wins the confidence of Gunn and recaptures the Hispaniola after cutting her hawser and sending Israel Hands to his death at the bottom of the sea. Following a near-fatal experience with the surviving pirates , Jim accompanies Silver on the treasure hunt. When the angry rogues discover that the treasure has been removed, Silver Shoots George Merry . Firing musket balls form the surrounding trees, Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and Ben Gunn force the remaining freebooters into the interior of the island. Trelawney and his crew stow the treasure safely in the Hispanolia's hold and leave provisions for the marooned pirates before setting sail for England. During a brief stop at a South American port, Silver, who faces trial and execution, steals a sack of coins and escapes over the rail. Jim Hawkins concludes: ""Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Capitan Flint. It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another world are very small. The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and the worst dreams that I ever have are when I hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears, ""Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!"""
Henry VIII,"The figure of the Prologue comes onto the stage to declare that what follows is a serious play. Several lords, including Buckingham, enter; Buckingham is angry that Cardinal Wolsey has such powerful influence over the king. Buckingham suspects Wolsey of being ambitious and disloyal. The other lords urge him to keep his words to himself, but just then, a guard comes to arrest Buckingham with the charge of treason. He goes quietly to jail. The king and queen attend a hearing in which Wolsey questions Buckingham's former employee about his loyalties. This man declares that Buckingham fancied himself next in line to the throne should the king die without an heir. Henry is angered and sentences Buckingham to death for disloyalty. However, the queen thinks that the Surveyor bears a grudge against Buckingham and has delivered lies in his testimony. Many lords go to a dinner party at Wolsey's house, and the king comes in disguise. Wolsey sees through the disguise, and the king meets Anne Bullen. He is very impressed with her beauty. Several men in the street discuss the trial of Buckingham, how he defended himself eloquently but was sentenced to death. The common people hate Wolsey, they all agree. Buckingham, speaks to the people, forgiving those who turned against him. He notes how his own death resembles that of his father, who also was killed by the king to whom he was loyal all his life. Several lords hear talk of the king's plan to divorce his wife, Katharine. Anne hears the news, too, and is sorry for Katharine, reflecting that she herself would never want to be the queen. Then, she receives a new title and money from the king, as a sign of his fondness for her. A cardinal from Rome arrives with the Pope's decision about whether Henry may divorce Katharine. Katharine beseeches the king not to divorce her, saying that she has been a loyal and honest wife to him for two decades. She calls Wolsey a traitor and refuses to submit to his will, sweeping out of the court. The king enumerates his reasons for believing his marriage to Katharine is unlawful and must be dissolved. Wolsey and the cardinal from Rome speak to Katharine, trying to convince her to go along with the divorce so she may stay under the king's care. She curses them for their role in her demise, which enrages her after so much faithfulness. The lords of the court now suspect Wolsey has been double-dealing in the divorce. But before they can work out a scheme to bring him down, Wolsey falls through his own inattention. The king intercepts an inventory of the possessions Wolsey has seized from fallen lords and a letter Wolsey wrote to the Pope urging the Pope to refuse the divorce request until Henry forgets his infatuation with Anne. The king confronts him and asks Wolsey if he has been a good servant, and Wolsey replies affirmatively. Then, the king shows him the papers he has uncovered. Wolsey knows he is lost. The lords deliver the king's charges against Wolsey, stripping him of his title and belongings. Wolsey regrets his ambitious behavior and sees that he was wrong to have tried to influence the affairs of state. Saying that he finally knows himself, he leaves the court. The king announces his marriage with Anne, and people in the street scramble to watch the procession to her coronation. Katharine has now been demoted to ""Princess Dowager,"" and she expects that her demise will lead soon to her death. Hearing of the death of Wolsey, she speaks against him again, but one of her attendants praises him. Katharine is, thus, convinced to forgive Wolsey. In the court, the lords hear that the queen is in labor. The king discovers a plot against his recently returned friend Cranmer, so he summons Cranmer to explain the complaints against him. Cranmer is convinced that he will fall into traps set for him, so the king gives him his ring as a sign of his support. Meanwhile, Anne gives birth to a female child. Cranmer is called before the Council, of which he is a member, to answer to complaints against him. The king watches the proceedings from above. The lords tell Cranmer that nothing can be done about the complaints while he is a Council member, so they want to make him into a regular citizen by confining him to the Tower. When guards arrives to take him away, Cranmer shows the lords the king's ring, and the king enters the Council to scold the lords for infighting, urging them to get along with each other. Cranmer forgives those who have plotted against him, specifically Gardiner. Commoners gather in the street to view the baptism of the king's daughter. Cranmer baptizes her as Elizabeth and speaks of her future greatness and the achievements both she and her successors will have. The Epilogue comes on stage, urging the audience to applaud."
The Valley of Fear,"The Valley of Fear begins with Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective, and Dr. Watson, his comrade and roommate at 221B Baker Street, in mid-conversation. Holmes is puzzling over an encrypted message that he received from Porlock, an associate of Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty. A second message from Porlock, which was supposed to contain the key to the coded message, soon arrives, stating that he is afraid of Moriarty's wrath and will not reveal the purpose of his correspondence. Holmes soon deciphers the message regardless, and discovers that it warns that Douglas of Birlstone is in imminent danger. The two are soon visited by MacDonald, a policeman friend of Holmes, who informs them that this same Douglas has been murdered. Upon inspection of the dead man, it is revealed that he has been killed with a sawed off shotgun, an American weapon. Beside the disfigured body lies a card inscribed 'V.V. 341'. Other clues in the room include a bloody footprint on the windowsill, a missing dumb-bell, and the fact that the man's wedding ring is missing. Another clue discovered soon after is a bicycle, concealed just outside the house grounds. Interrogation of the house servants reveals little, and after Mrs. Douglas, wife of the murdered man, and Cecil Barker, a friend of the family, are questioned, Holmes reveals to Watson that he believes the two are in a conspiracy together. Although the other detectives on the scene share their own theories, Holmes informs Watson that he believes the case hangs entirely on the missing dumb-bell, the one piece of evidence deemed trivial by the police force. Holmes announces that he is going to spend the night alone in the room in which Douglas was murdered, taking nothing with him but Watson's umbrella. The day after Holmes' vigil, he reveals to the police force investigating Douglas' murder that he has solved the case, and asks them to join him in a stakeout that night. During the stakeout, which takes place in the bushes outside of the room in which the crime was committed, Holmes, Watson, and the other detectives witness a man lean out the window and fish something out of the moat that surrounds the house. When the group confronts the figure, they discover it is Cecil Barker, and that the object he has taken from the moat is a bag, weighed down with the missing dumb-bell. Within the bag is a suit of clothing, boots, and a knife. During his stay in the room, Holmes discovered this same bag using the crook of Watson's umbrella, and put it back to wait for Barker to retrieve it. To the astonishment of the others, Holmes reveals that Douglas is still alive. Upon saying this, a hidden compartment in the room opens, and Douglas himself steps out. Douglas proceeds to explain that he had been hunted for some time by a man named Baldwin, who later attempted to kill him. The two struggled, and Baldwin died when the shotgun went off in his face. With the assistance of his wife and Barker, Douglas concocted a plan to fake his own death, taking advantage of the fact that Baldwin's disfigured face would prevent an accurate identification. Douglas explains that there are others who would seek his life, and his apparent death would enable him to shake them off forever. Douglas gives Watson a manuscript, which he says details his past life, and tells of the men who wish him dead. After this, the novel shifts to Part II, which deals with Douglas' life in America. Part II begins with a man named Jack McMurdo, . McMurdo journeys to Vermissa Valley, a coal mining district in the western United States. McMurdo expresses an extreme hatred of policemen, which attracts the attention of a man named Scanlan. Scanlan reveals himself to be a member of the order of the Freemen, a society to which McMurdo also belongs. McMurdo soon joins the local lodge of Freemen, headed up by a cruel, violent man named Boss McGinty. It is revealed that the Freemen of this district go by another name: the Scowrers, a Mafia-like society that oppresses the people of Vermissa Valley. McMurdo proves to be just as violent as the rest, and he soon becomes a prominent member of the Scowrers. The gang continues their reign of terror without being challenged, until they learn that Birdy Edwards, a Pinkerton detective, is on their trail. McMurdo informs the lodge that he knows who Birdy Edwards is, and he lays a plan to capture him. McMurdo lures Edwards to his apartment, where Boss McGinty and several of the other prominent members of the gang are concealed. McMurdo suddenly turns the tables on the Scowrers by revealing that he himself is Birdy Edwards, and that he joined the lodge only to gain information to use against them. McGinty and several of the others are hanged based on McMurdo's testimony, and the others are sent to prison. Edwards, knowing the vindictive nature of the gang, disappears, eventually ending up in England, where events play out as detailed in Part I. After Douglas' remarkable story, Holmes warns the man to remain on his guard, as Moriarty, whom Baldwin contacted to locate Douglas' whereabouts, will no doubt attempt to kill Douglas himself. Douglas agrees and goes back into hiding. Sometime after Douglas flees England, Holmes receives a cryptic message which reads only ""Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me!"" . From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty, the sender of the note, has succeeded in killing Douglas. Watson and McDonald speculate as to whether or not Moriarty will ever be brought to justice. Holmes assures them that he will capture the Professor, but he needs time in order to do so."
The Invisible Man,"Here's the super-short version: The Invisible Man doesn't get along with anyone in society: he didn't get along with anyone before he was invisible and now things have only gotten worse. He thinks the laws shouldn't apply to him and eventually he gets killed by a mob. Epic fail, Invisible Man. Here's the slightly longer version: The Invisible Man starts with a stranger arriving at the town of Iping. He's a private guy, which is a problem when you live in a town where the major export is gossip. The stranger doesn't get along with the villagers, especially the people who own the inn where he's staying. He spends most of his time trying to do something scientific in his room. But eventually - after the villagers accuse him of robbery - the stranger snaps. He takes off all his clothes and reveals that he's - wait for it - invisible! The Invisible Man fights the village and flees, leaving his important scientific notes behind. To get them back, he forces a homeless dude named Marvel to help him. They go back to Iping and get the Invisible Man's stuff, but the villagers attack and craziness ensues. The Invisible Man beats them to a pulp and wreaks some major havoc. At another town , the Invisible Man steals money and drops it into Marvel's pockets. Like the lousy sidekick he is, Marvel runs away to Burdock, money in hand . The IM tries to kill Marvel, but a bunch of people at a bar fight him off; one person even shoots him, but it's just a scratch. The Invisible Man takes shelter in a house that happens to be owned by an old college friend named Kemp, and this is where we learn that our not-so-hero's name is Griffin. While staying in his digs, Griffin tells Kemp his back story story, which is several chapters long . Here's the gist: he was poor and he wanted to study invisibility , so he stole money from his father, who then committed suicide . Finally Griffin figured out the invisibility thing and proceeded to do a few things: burn down his landlord's building; wander around London; steal from a department store; and put on a ridiculous outfit from a theatrical costume shop and go to Iping to work. Turns out Kemp had alerted the police to Griffin's whereabouts when he arrived, but when they come to arrest him, he escapes. Kemp works with the police to catch Griffin, who in turn, tries to catch Kemp. In the end, a bunch of people in Burdock gang up on the Invisible Man and kill him. As he dies, Griffin loses his invisibility and we get our first glimpse of the Visible Man. Finally, in the epilogue, we learn that Marvel still has Griffin's scientific notes, which probably have all sorts of cool inventions in them."
Vanity Fair,"The novel opens at Miss Pinkerton's Academy for young women, where readers are introduced to Amelia and Becky, the novel's female protagonists. Amelia and Becky are friends, but they are nothing alike. Amelia is kind and innocent and comes from a family with money. Becky Sharp, on the other hand, is sharp and scheming and emerges from an impoverished situation. Miss Pinkerton, utterly disgusted with Becky's behavior, sets her up in a governess position at the Crawley estate. Before she takes her position, Becky spends a little over a week at Amelia's home. She spends her time ingratiating herself with the Sedleys and wooing Amelia's brother Jos, an overweight, shy and vain tax collector on break from his job in India. Becky nearly succeeds in arranging the marriage, until George, Amelia's love interest, steps in and convinces Jos he has behaved like a fool. Jos, humiliated, abandons home and Becky, furious with George, moves on to her job. The Crawleys are a rather despicable bunch and nothing like what Becky suspected. They are all scheming for the inheritance of Aunt Matilda, who is ill. Becky once again ingratiates herself with the family and earns the particular affections of Sir Pitt and Rawdon, who both ask for her hand in marriage. She admits begrudgingly to Sir Pitt that she agreed to marry Rawdon in secret, and everyone in the family is outraged when they hear this news. Meanwhile, Amelia pines over George, who disrespects and disregards her while he is in the military. Dobbin, who is George's closest friend and who is also secretly in love with Amelia, begs him to treat her kindly. George eventually agrees to marry Amelia, but just as his father predicted, the Sedleys come to financial ruin because of Mr. Sedley's poor business decisions. George's father disowns him in response to Dobbin's efforts to get him to accept the marriage. The Duke of Wellington has declared war on Napoleon's army; since all the men are in the military, everyone goes to Belgium to prepare for the war. When the husbands go off to fight, the general's wife takes care of the women who are left behind. Amelia worries about George, and Rawdon mourns having to leave Becky, but Becky seems unconcerned about her soon-to-be husband and instead appears to be developing a flirtation with George. Unfortunately, George dies in the Battle of Waterloo. Sir Pitt, in the wake of his second wife's death, takes up with his butler's daughter, causing scandal at the household. The young Pitt Crawley finds a sweet wife who manages to earn the approval of Aunt Matilda, who never thought much of the older of Sir Pitt's sons. Both Amelia and Becky give birth to sons, and for a while Becky and Rawdon manage to live well on very little money; Becky is skilled at avoiding payments. The Sedleys, on the other hand, continue to slip further into financial ruin. Amelia sends Georgy, her son, to live with the Osbornes because of her difficult situation. When Sir Pitt dies, young Mr. Crawley inherits the estate and Aunt Matilda's money, and he invites Becky and Rawdon and their son to come live with him. Becky ingratiates herself with a man named Lord Steyne, who brings her out into society, sends little Rawdon, her son, away from school, and generally distracts her from her husband. When she neglects to send money to get Rawdon out of prison, where he has landed himself for unpaid gambling debts, he decides to investigate her new relationship. When he returns home, he finds jewels in her belongings, and he decides to duel Lord Steyne. The fight is avoided, but Rawdon moves away. Dobbin returns to England, and he finds Amelia, who is still grieving the loss of George. Dobbin stays anyway to help Amelia care for her son. Mr. Osborne dies and leaves some of his money for Amelia and Georgy, and three of them go off to Europe, where they find Becky. Becky admits to Amelia that she had been developing a relationship with George, and Amelia finally comes to her senses, sees George for who he really was, and marries Dobbin."
News from Nowhere,"The narrator has been told a story by a friend from the Socialist League in Victorian England, which he informs the reader he will tell from the first-person perspective. The character, who tells others to call him ""William Guest"" later in the story, goes to sleep in late-19th-century England and wakes up in the same spot in the 21st century. He is taken under the wing of Dick Hammond, who shows him life in the 21st century by inviting him to travel up the Thames to help with the harvest. On the way, William is able to learn about the history of England between the 19th and 21st centuries, especially from Dick's great-great-grandfather Old Hammond, and about the current society in England which differs from the England of the 19th century in many ways, including the systems of education, justice, and marriage. They also pick up and drop off a number of characters along the way, the most prominent of whom are Dick's past lover Clara and William's love interest Ellen. Dick, William, Clara, and Ellen reach the site where Dick has friends harvesting after a number of days of travel and after William has revealed where and when he is truly from to Ellen. At a festive dinner, the other characters suddenly stop being able to see William, and he walks away into a black fog. He wakes up back in the 19th century, but says that what he saw was more a vision than a dream."
The Way of All Flesh,"Old John Pontifex, the great-grandfather of the central character, Ernest, is a gentle, artistically gifted, and unpretentious carpenter in the village of Paleham. Unfortunately, his one and only child, George, reflects the characteristics of his obstinate and humorless mother. Following an apprenticeship, George assumes control of his uncle's London publishing house, which caters to the pious tastes of the middle-class reading public. Although outwardly a respectable businessman, George is a domestic tyrant, particularly to his youngest son, Theobald. Weak-willed and unable to execute his vague aspirations to become a seafaring man, Theobald easily capitulates to his father's insistence that he enter the Anglican ministry. Shortly after taking orders, Theobald meets Christina Allaby, one of five unmarried daughters in the family of the rector whom Theobald serves as curate. After winning matrimonial rights to Theobald from her sisters in a game of cards, Christina, tacitly in league with her mother, induces Theobald to propose marriage. Following a prolonged engagement, during which Theobald realizes he holds no genuine affection for Christina, he again goes against his better judgment by honoring his commitment. George's opposition to his son's financially unprofitable match leads Theobald to rationalize that his entering into a loveless marriage is a noble act. Unlike his father in almost every other way, Theobald is very like him as an authoritarian. He is determined to seek out and destroy the least sign of individuality in any of his children, and it is the oldest child, Ernest, who is made to suffer the frontal wave of his assault. Ernest is beaten for mispronouncing words, denied pocket money, and given ""pleasure"" by being allowed to select his own hymn to sing at Sunday evening service. Although his mother is far better natured and gentler than Theobald, she eventually alienates Ernest by betraying his confidences to Theobald, who promptly administers punishment to his son. Neither Ernest's younger brother nor sister is the kind of playmate who can alleviate the harsh domestic regime, for they invariably submit to their parents' demands. Only the household servants provide Ernest with pleasurable companionship. At age twelve, Ernest enters Roughborough School, whose headmaster, Dr. Skinner, treats his charges much the same way that Theobald treats his children. Ernest is apathetic in his studies, dislikes athletics, begins to smoke and drink, but is not unpopular with his schoolmates. When Ernest's Aunt Alethea moves to Roughborough, she provides Ernest relief from his depressing existence by arranging lessons in carpentry for him and brightening his drab life with her cheerful company. Unfortunately, she is suddenly stricken with typhoid fever and dies; she arranges her will, however, so that Ernest will receive most of her sizable estate on his twenty-eighth birthday. Another misfortune befalls Ernest when he is home during a long vacation. Ellen, a friendly and charming servant girl at Battersby, is dismissed from service by Theobald when she is discovered to be pregnant. Christina half hopes that Ernest is the father, but he is innocent; he is guilty, however, of having given Ellen all his personal possessions of any value to help her on her way. When Theobald discovers Ernest's act, he forces a confession from Ernest and then extorts knowledge from him of his and the other schoolboys' vices at Roughborough. Ernest is agonized at having to tell tales out of school, and after he returns to Roughborough, he is severely punished by Dr. Skinner. The other boys readily forgive him, however, when he voluntarily admits his perfidy, and they gain revenge on Theobald by burning him in effigy on Guy Fawke's day, ironically the day of Ernest's confirmation. After completing his studies at Roughborough, Ernest enters Emmanual College of Cambridge University; there he enjoys a new freedom, gains at least a modest reputation as an intellectual, and takes an honors degree. Unfortunately, after showing flashes of distinctive literary gifts and a sense of humor, Ernest falls under the influence of the Simeonites, a small group of evangelistically fervent students. When he writes to his parents of his religious ardor, they are more frightened than amused; Theobald nonetheless insists that his son take religious orders, and Ernest complies. Ernest requests and subsequently receives an appointment as a junior curate in a London parish which is populated by the lower classes who are, for the most part, indifferent to religion. Under the spell of a slightly older curate, Pryer, Ernest hopes to found a College of Spiritual Pathology to treat disorders of the soul in much the same manner as physicians treat ailments of the body. Unfortunately, Ernest entrusts a small inheritance to Pryer for speculation in the stock market -- the intended profits of this venture will enable them to advance God's work in the world more quickly. Unable to contain his enthusiasm, however, Ernest begins a private evangelical campaign of his own within the confines of his Ashpit Place boarding house. He is rebuffed at every clumsy attempt to gain converts; the culmination of his efforts is a complete fiasco, for he mistakes a decent young woman for a prostitute, approaches her boldly, and promptly finds himself put under arrest for attempted assault. In spite of the efforts of his godfather, Edward Overton, and a college acquaintance, Towneley, Ernest is sentenced to serve six months at hard labor in Coldbath Fields Prison. Upon reaching prison, Ernest suffers an attack of brain fever and remains bedfast for two months. Once he is sufficiently recovered, Ernest is apprenticed to the prison tailor and is given the post of chapel organist. He learns of Pryer's absconding with his inheritance and his father's renunciation of him at the same time. The prison chaplain gives him practical advice and makes no attempt to dissuade Ernest from leaving the ministry. By the time his sentence is completed, Ernest has not only renounced Christianity but his parents as well, telling them to think of him as one who is dead. With the help of Overton, Ernest reenters the world but is unsuccessful in his attempts to gain employment as a tailor. A chance meeting with Ellen, the servant discharged by Theobald when Ernest was yet at Roughborough, gives him the idea of opening a used-clothing shop, a line of work in which Ellen is experienced. Ernest quickly becomes infatuated with Ellen, who is extremely attractive despite having led a dissolute life in London. Overton is upset by Ernest's determination to marry her but advances the young couple money for the leasing of a shop which also provides living quarters. Both the marriage and the business prosper at first, but when Ellen tires of her role as the wife of a well-educated and refined husband, she begins to drink heavily, a practice which she artfully conceals from Ernest. He attributes her strange behavior to being with child, and only after she lapses into drinking a second time, when carrying her second child, does the naive Ernest understand the true cause of her distress. Resigned to a burdensome marriage and almost certain penury, Ernest suddenly gains relief upon hearing the testimony of her father's former coachman who left Battersby at the time of Ellen's dismissal. The testimony, to the effect that the coachman and Ellen had earlier married, prompts Ernest to arrange a separation from his supposed wife and to place his children first in the care of Overton's laundress and later in a foster home. With less than two years remaining before Ernest is to receive his Aunt Alethea's legacy, now grown to a considerable fortune, Overton decides that his godson has suffered enough and employs him as his secretary. Ernest's main duty is to manage the sums of money which, unknown to him, are soon to be his own. Ernest's shock and surprise when he comes into his fortune is matched only by that of Theobald. Called to his dying mother's bedside, Ernest does not flaunt his wealth; he acts firmly with his father and gently indulges his mother's concerns for her soul-worthiness. The reconciliation with his parents rounds out Ernest's prolonged and harassing process of maturation. Financially able to do as he pleases, Ernest first goes abroad for a number of years and then returns to set himself up as an intellectual gadfly, determined to attack the shams of a society which, willing or not, needs his corrective treatment."
Henry IV Part 2,"We begin shortly after the battle of Shrewsbury, in which King Henry IV was victorious over the rebel forces and Prince Hal killed Harry Hotspur in single combat. But another rebellion is on its way. We open with Northumberland, one of the rebels and Hotspur's father, learning that Hotspur is dead and that Shrewsbury was a victory for Henry IV. Northumberland prepares for battle, sending letters to powerful men throughout Britain who have no love for the king. Shrewsbury may be over, but King Henry's troubles are far from over. Meanwhile, we see our old friend John Falstaff, fresh from the battle of Shrewsbury, basking in his new reputation as a great warrior. Because of this reputation and because he has new orders from Prince Hal, the Lord Chief Justice does not arrest Falstaff for previous crimes. The rebels continue to plan. Mowbray, Bardolph, Hastings, and the Archbishop of York wonder if they can still defeat the king if Northumberland withdraws his support. They must proceed prepared for the possibility that Northumberland will abandon them. But to their advantage, the king faces war on three fronts. Besides the rebels, King Henry faces hostile action from the French and the Welsh. Act Two: Falstaff runs into trouble in London when Hostess Quickly tries to have him arrested as a debtor. Falstaff not only persuades her to drop the charges, but he also convinces her to let him borrow more money. Falstaff decides to dine with her and others of the Eastcheap crowd. Hal and Poins, hearing that Falstaff will be eating in Eastcheap, resolve to disguise themselves as waiters to see what he acts like when Hal isn't around. Meanwhile, Lady Percy and Northumberland's wife convince Northumberland to withdraw his support from the other rebels. Northumberland decides to hide in Scotland and wait until a more opportune time presents itself. In Eastcheap, Hal and Poins, both disguised, observe Falstaff. They hear him making insulting comments about both of them. Hal confronts him, and Falstaff humiliated, tries to get out of it by saying that he condemned the prince in front of the wicked so that the wicked would stay away from him. Hal forces the issue, trapping Falstaff and making him condemn all those present. Act Three: Henry IV, ill, frail, and wracked with anxiety, consults with his advisors about the insurrections. The dream of a Crusade to the Holy Land seems farther and farther away, especially with the king's health fading fast. On his way to join Prince John, Falstaff stops in Gloucestershire to pick up recruits for the king's army and to see his old friend, Justice Shallow. We soon see that Falstaff is incredibly jealous of his old friend, who has prospered greatly. Falstaff resolves to return to Gloucestershire after the battle to swindle Shallow. Act Four: At Gaultree Forest, Mowbray, Hastings, and the Archbishop parlay with Westmoreland and Prince John. After being promised that their grievances will be addressed, the rebels agree to a peaceful resolution. They disband their army, with assurances that Prince John will do the same. After the rebel army is disbanded, Prince John arrests all of them and charges them with capital treason. They are to be executed promptly. Afterwards, Falstaff meets a rebel knight who surrenders to him on account of Falstaff's reputation. Falstaff meets with Prince John, who scolds him for arriving late. Falstaff presents his prisoner and then asks if he can return to London via Gloucestershire. The permission is granted. The king hears the good news about the battle and falls into a swoon. Hal sits watching the king and thinks him dead; he takes the crown and puts it on his own head. But the king wakes, and berates Hal's eagerness. Hal apologizes, explaining his actions, and the king is satisfied. He gives Hal the last advice Hal will ever hear from him. Having never reached the Holy Land, the king asks to be brought to the Jerusalem chamber to die. Act Five: In Gloucestershire, Falstaff observes Shallow and his servants. He hopes to collect material for amusing stories to tell Hal. Meanwhile, Hal is assuring his brothers and his father's old advisors that his past should not serve as an indicator for the kind of king he will be. In particular, he assures the Lord Chief Justice that despite their rocky past, the Chief Justice will continue to be one of his most important advisors. On hearing of the king's death, Falstaff, Shallow, and members of the Eastcheap crowd set out for London. Falstaff kneels, waiting eagerly for the king to pass by. He imagines that Hal's reign will mean a position of great power and affluence for him. But Hal, now Henry V, treats him coldly. He tells him that he does not know him; as he has cast off his former self, so must he cast off his former associates. He forbids Falstaff, on pain of death, to come within ten miles of his person. After the king leaves, Falstaff is in denial. He believes that Hal will send for him privately. Falstaff and the others are ordered to board the Fleet. The king calls Parliament: it looks like Henry V will soon lead an invasion of France."
Macbeth,"The play takes place in Scotland. Duncan, the king of Scotland, is at war with the king of Norway. As the play opens, he learns of Macbeth's bravery in a victorious battle against Macdonald--a Scot who sided with the Norwegians. At the same time, news arrives concerning the arrest of the treacherous Thane of Cawdor. Duncan decides to give the title of Thane of Cawdor to Macbeth. As Macbeth and Banquo return home from battle, they meet three witches. The witches predict that Macbeth will be thane of Cawdor and king of Scotland, and that Banquo will be the father of kings. After the witches disappear, Macbeth and Banquo meet two noblemen Ross and Angus, who announce Macbeth's new title as thane of Cawdor. Upon hearing this, Macbeth begins to contemplate the murder of Duncan in order to realize the witches' second prophecy. Macbeth and Banquo meet with Duncan, who announces that he is going to pay Macbeth a visit at his castle. Macbeth rides ahead to prepare his household. Meanwhile, Lady Macbeth receives a letter from Macbeth informing her of the witches' prophesy and its subsequent realization. A servant appears to inform her of Duncan's approach. Energized by the news, Lady Macbeth invokes supernatural powers to strip her of feminine softness and thus prepare her for the murder of Duncan. When Macbeth arrives, Lady Macbeth tells him that she will plot Duncan's murder. When Duncan arrives at the castle, Lady Macbeth greets him alone. When Macbeth fails to appear, Lady Macbeth finds him is in his room, contemplating the weighty and evil decision to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth taunts him by telling him that he will only be a man if he kills Duncan. She then tells him her plan for the murder, which Macbeth accepts: they will kill him while his drunken bodyguards sleep, then plant incriminating evidence on the bodyguards. Act 2 Macbeth sees a vision of a bloody dagger floating before him, leading him to Duncan's room. When he hears Lady Macbeth ring the bell to signal the completion of her preparations, Macbeth sets out to complete his part in the murderous plan. Lady Macbeth waits for Macbeth to finish the act of regicide. Macbeth enters, still carrying the bloody daggers. Lady Macbeth again chastises him for his weak-mindedness and plants the daggers on the bodyguards herself. While she does so, Macbeth imagines that he hears a haunting voice saying that he shall sleep no more. Lady Macbeth returns and assures Macbeth that ""a little water clears us of this deed"" . As the thanes Macduff and Lennox arrive, the porter pretends that he is guarding the gate to hell. Immediately thereafter, Macduff discovers Duncan's dead body. Macbeth kills the two bodyguards, claiming that he was overcome with a fit of grief and rage when he saw them with the bloody daggers. Duncan's sons Malcolm and Donalbain, fearing their lives to be in danger, flee to England and Ireland. Their flight brings them under suspicion of conspiring against Duncan. Macbeth is thus crowned king of Scotland. Act 3 In an attempt to thwart the witches' prophesy that Banquo will father kings, Macbeth hires two murderers to kill Banquo and his son Fleance. Lady Macbeth is left uninformed of these plans. A third murderer joins the other two on the heath and the three men kill Banquo. Fleance, however, manages to escape. Banquo's ghost appears to Macbeth as he sits down to a celebratory banquet, sending him into a frenzy of terror. Lady Macbeth attempts to cover up for his odd behavior but the banquet comes to a premature end as the thanes begin to question Macbeth's sanity. Macbeth decides that he must revisit the witches to look into the future once more. Meanwhile, Macbeth's thanes begin to turn against him. Macduff meets Malcolm in England to prepare an army to march on Scotland. Act 4 The witches show Macbeth three apparitions. The first warns him against Macduff, the second tells him to fear no man born of woman, and the third prophesizes that he will fall only when Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane castle. Macbeth takes this as a prophecy that he is infallible. When he asks the witches if their prophesy about Banquo will come true, they show him a procession of eight kings, all of whom look like Banquo. Meanwhile in England, Malcolm tests Macduff's loyalty by pretending to confess to multiple sins and malicious ambitions. When Macduff proves his loyalty to Scotland, the two strategize for their offensive against Macbeth. Back in Scotland, Macbeth has Macduff's wife and children murdered. Act 5 Lady Macbeth suffers from bouts of sleepwalking. To a doctor who observes her symptoms, she unwittingly reveals her guilt as she pronounces that she cannot wash her hands clean of bloodstains. Macbeth is too preoccupied with battle preparations to pay much heed to her dreams and expresses anger when the doctor says he cannot cure her. Just as the English army led by Malcolm, Macduff, Siward approaches, Lady Macbeth's cry of death is heard in the castle. When Macbeth hears of her death, he comments that she should have died at a future date and muses on the meaninglessness of life. Taking the witches' second prophecies in good faith, Macbeth still believes that he is impregnable to the approaching army. But Malcolm has instructed each man in the English army to cut a tree branch from Birnam Wood and hold it up to disguise the army's total numbers. As a result, Macbeth's servant reports that he has seen a seemingly impossible sight: Birnam Wood seems to be moving toward the castle. Macbeth is shaken but still engages the oncoming army. In battle, Macbeth kills Young Siward, the English general's brave son. Macduff then challenges Macbeth. As they fight, Macduff reveals that he was not ""of woman born"" but was ""untimely ripped"" from his mother's womb . Macbeth is stunned but refuses to yield to Macduff. Macduff kills him and decapitates him. At the end of the play, Malcolm is proclaimed the new king of Scotland."
Troilus and Cressida,"A prologue announces that the play is set during the Trojan War. Troilus, a Trojan prince, wishes to marry Cressida, a Trojan noble whose father, Calchas, has defected to the Greeks. Troilus woos Cressida with the help of a go-between, Cressida's uncle Pandarus. At the play's beginning, this suit does not seem to be going well; however, Cressida secretly loves Troilus in return. Meanwhile, the Greek camp is in crisis. Achilles, their greatest warrior, has openly defied the leaders of the Greek cause , and refuses to fight. Instead he sits in his tent with his lover, Patroclus, and puts on impromptu plays ridiculing the Greek leadership. A doltish new warrior, Ajax, has recently arrived, and Ulysses plots to elevate Ajax in order to make Achilles jealous, thereby enticing the great fighter back onto the battlefield. A challenge from the Trojan champion Hector provides Ulysses with his opportunity; he arranges things so that Ajax will fight Hector, and thereby win the glory that Achilles so values. Back in the Trojan camp, Pandarus has made speedy progress with his efforts to get Troilus and Cressida together. Though the two lovers are somewhat shy, they spend a night together in Pandarus' house. Unfortunately, that very night Calchas arranges to have his daughter brought to the Greek camp in exchange for a Trojan prisoner. The morning after her tryst with Troilus, Cressida is taken to the Greeks, though not before promising to remain true to Troilus. The Greeks pass her around for kisses when she enters the camp. Ajax's approaching battle with Hector has greatly inflated his already formidable ego, and Achilles has indeed grown jealous. Ulysses exacerbates Achilles' jealousy with his eloquence. The challenge between Hector and Ajax is cut short when Hector declares that he does not wish to fight Ajax, as Ajax is half-Trojan. On this note of chivalry, the Greeks and Trojans feast together. In the course of this feast the two great warriors, Hector and Achilles, trade words and swear to meet each other in battle the next day. Troilus arranges for Ulysses to take him to Calchas' tent after the feast, where he hopes to see Cressida. Upon arriving at Cressida's tent, however, Troilus is mortified to discover her flirting with and kissing a Greek, Diomedes. She promises to meet Diomedes later in the night, obviously intending to sleep with him. Troilus is devastated by Cressida's betrayal and vows to kill Diomedes in the next day's battle. Despite the misgivings of Andromache and Cassandra, Hector and Troilus enter the battle. Troilus meets Diomedes on the field, though he doesn't kill him. The battle goes well for the Trojans at first. Soon, however, Patroclus is killed, and Achilles arranges to slaughter Hector; he surrounds the unarmed Trojan with his soldiers and massacres him, then drags the body through the fields behind his horse. Seeing this, Troilus swears to dedicate his strength to destroying Achilles and the Greeks. The play ends with a speech from Pandarus, who begs us to pity his misfortune in having brought untrue lovers together."
Richard II,"Richard II opens with Mowbray and Bolingbroke accusing each other of treason in front of Richard. He attempts to make the two noblemen make peace, but is unable to control them. Instead, Richard agrees to let them hold a medieval trial by combat in which the two men will fight to see who is right. On the day of the trial, Richard allows the ceremony to proceed right up until the noblemen actually start fighting. He symbolically allows his warder fall to the ground. The ceremony is halted and Richard takes over. He orders Mowbray to be permanently banished from England, and banishes Bolingbroke for ten years. Mowbray leaves, and Richard then quickly reduces Bolingbroke's sentence to only six years in an effort to make John of Gaunt happier. After Bolingbroke is gone, Richard starts to prepare his army for a war with Ireland. However, because he lacks money, Richard tells his men to start issuing forced loans on the nobles, and he also sells his right to tax. One of Richard's allies, Bushy, tells him that John of Gaunt is near dying. Richard quickly calculates that he can seize Gaunt's estates to finance his war. He therefore goes to visit Gaunt, who tells Richard that his ""fierce blaze of riot cannot last"" . Gaunt passes away soon thereafter, and Richard takes over the estate which legally should have been inherited by Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke meanwhile has organized an army and sailed northward. When he hears that Richard has confiscated his estates, he uses the seizure as an excuse to invade England. Richard unfortunately leaves for Ireland unaware that Bolingbroke has landed on English soil. In London, the Duke of York is in power during Richard's absence, and he is forced to go meet with Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke tells York that he has only come to reclaim his lands and nothing more. Richard arrives with his army in Wales only to discover that the Welsh army has disbanded and returned home. He is therefore unable to muster enough troops to actively fight with Bolingbroke. To make matters worse, he is told that York has ceded all of his northern castles to Bolingbroke, thus making it impossible for Richard to defeat Bolingbroke in a war. Richard disbands his army and goes to Flint castle. Bolingbroke finds Richard's allies, Bushy and Green, and executes them. He then marches to Flint castle and orders Richard to return his lands and inheritance. Rather than defend the castle, Richard chooses to come down from his position on top of the castle walls and meet Bolingbroke directly. Bolingbroke kneels before him, but Richard makes his cousin stand up and tells him that he will go with him to London. Once in London Bolingbroke realizes that he must make Richard willingly give him the throne. He calls Richard before Parliament so that nobles can watch what happens. Richard brings his scepter and crown with him, and tells Bolingbroke to seize the crown from him. Richard then invokes the image of the coronation ceremony, but performs it in reverse, giving up his powers rather than assuming them. Bolingbroke finally agrees to let Richard go, and sends him to the Tower of London. Richard's Queen sees him being led to the Tower and tries to go with him, but Northumberland will not let her. Instead, she is sent to France and Richard is sent north to Pomfret. Sir Piers Exton overhears Bolingbroke remark that Richard is someone he fears. Exton therefore decides to go to Pomfret and kill Richard. The Duke of York's son, Aumerle, arrives home with a letter plotting against Bolingbroke, who has already accepted the crown and become King Henry IV. However, York snatches the letter from his son and denounces him as a traitor. York then grabs a horse and leaves to inform Henry about his son's act of treason. Both Aumerle and the Duchess of York race to London in the hopes of arriving before York and begging forgiveness from Henry. Aumerle barely arrives ahead of his father, and Henry chooses to grant him mercy, although his fellow traitors are ordered killed. Exton arrives in Pomfret where Richard is being held and attacks Richard. Richard manages to grab a sword and kill two men before being mortally wounded himself. He dies, and Exton takes his body back to London for King Henry IV to see. Henry, however, is not happy to see Richard dead, because it means that he will have to defend his throne against supporters of Richard who would not have attacked him as long as Richard remained alive. The play ends with Henry vowing to make a trip to the Holy Land as a form of penance for allowing Richard to be killed."
Henry IV Part 1,"Henry IV, Part One details the struggle of King Henry IV to maintain his control of the English throne which he usurped from Richard II. The play begins with news that one of his commanders, Mortimer, has lost a battle to Glyndwr in Wales. However, another commander, Hotspur, has succeeded in defeating Douglas in Scotland, but refuses to send his prisoners back to the king. Henry is furious about this, since prisoners are a way of earning money through ransom. He orders Hotspur to yield the prisoners under threat of punishment. Hotspur, impulsive as always, tells his father Northumberland that he will never give up the prisoners. Worcester tells Hotspur that it would be smarter to turn over the prisoners but at the same time form an alliance with Douglas and Glyndwr, and thus raise an army with which to overthrow Henry IV. Hal, the affectionate name for Prince Harry, the son of King Henry, is a prodigal and a madcap (thief). He wastes his time in taverns with the lower classes of English society, and spends a great deal of time with a fat nobleman named Falstaff. In the first act Hal agrees to participate in a robbery in order to experience it. However, at the end of the scene and in soliloquy, Hal indicates to the audience that he is merely in disguise, and that he fully expects to assume the reins of power in the near future. The thieves, led by Falstaff, carry out their robbery. Hal and Poins, another robber, play a trick on the thieves by robbing the money from Falstaff. The next night in the tavern Falstaff tells a roaringly funny tale about how he fought with many men before being defeated. Hal finally reveals the secret of the attackers to him, at which point Falstaff claims that he knew who it was all along, but that he did not wish to harm the Prince of Wales (Hal). The rebels, led by Hotspur, unite Douglas from Scotland and Glyndwr in Wales. Together with the Archbishop of York they start to raise an army, gathering their forces at Shrewsbury. Hotspur does not get along well with Glyndwr, whom he views as being too mystical. The men also start to argue about how they will split up the territories, since Hotspur wants England, Douglas Scotland, and Glyndwr Wales. King Henry calls Hal into his throne room and begs his son to mend his ways. Hal agrees to ""be more myself"" in the future. Henry then informs his son that the rebels are mobilizing near Shrewsbury, and Hal receives a military command. He immediately starts to prepare for war with Hotspur. Henry assembles his own armies and starts moving towards Shrewsbury. Almost as a joke, Falstaff receives an infantry command from Hal, which is difficult for him since he is too fat to be able to walk very far. At Shrewsbury, King Henry offers to fully pardon the rebels if they decamp and return to their homes. Hotspur's agent, Worcester, fails to deliver this message to Hotspur because he is convinced that Henry will not honor the pardon. Thus Hotspur feels trapped into fighting. To make matters worse, Glyndwr is unable to arrive on time, causing the rebels to have far fewer men than they had expected. At the same time, Northumberland falls ill and is unable to help rally his troops. Hotspur, unable to wait any longer, decides to go ahead with the battle preparations anyway. Henry puts nobles on the field dressed as himself as a form of protection. Douglas kills several of the impersonators before encountering Henry. The two men start to fight, but Hal arrives in time to save his father and chase Douglas away. Henry comments that he is sorry he ever doubted his son's abilities. Hal next encounters Hotspur. After a brief exchange of words they start to fight with on another. While the two young men are fighting, Falstaff arrives and encourages Hal to victory. Douglas also arrives and attacks Falstaff, who soon falls down as if he were dead. Hal succeeds in killing Hotspur, but is sad that Falstaff has also been killed. No sooner does Hal depart then Falstaff gets back to his feet and stabs Hotspur's body. He then picks up Hotspur and takes the credit for killing him. Hal cannot believe Falstaff's lies, but decides it is not worth arguing about. King Henry succeeds in winning the battle once the leaders are killed or captured. He sentences Worcester and Vernon to death for their failure to offer his pardon to Hotspur. Hal chooses to pardon Douglas and set him free, realizing that this is strategically necessary if he wants to rule Scotland in the future. Henry then splits his army into two parts, one of which will march on York, the other of which will attack Glyndwr."
King John,"Read the full text of King John with a side-by-side translation HERE. King John is chillaxing on the English throne when a messenger from King Philip of France shows up and declares that John's claim to the throne is totally bogus. King Philip wants him to hand over the crown ASAP to John's young nephew, Arthur, who should have become king when Richard I died. King John is all, ""Fat chance. I'm the rightful king. Prepare for war."" He sends the French messenger packing. King John slaps his army together and sails to France for a big showdown with King Philip's forces outside the walls of Angers. The two kings try to negotiate but get nowhere fast, so the English and French armies go to war. The battle is a draw. Finally, the citizens of Angers come up with a better plan--King John's niece Blanche should marry King Philip's son Louis, creating an alliance between the two kingdoms. Yay. Problem solved. Just after Blanche and Louis exchange vows and smash wedding cake into each other's faces, Cardinal Pandolf shows up on a mission from the Pope. The Pope is all mad because King John won't do what he's told. John is all ""I'm the King of England--the Pope doesn't get to tell me what to do."" In response, Pandolf announces that 1) John is banned from the Church, and 2) the Church will give special props to anyone who takes him out. Then Pandolf orders King Philip to stop being friends and political allies with King John... or else. King Philip obeys, and France and England go to war... again. This time, the English army takes little Arthur prisoner. Before they sail back to England, King John tells Hubert that he wants the little brat dead, PRONTO. The scene shifts back to England, to the castle where poor Arthur is being held prisoner. It turns out that Hubert is actually supposed to burn out the kid's eyes with hot iron pokers. But Hubert and Arthur have become chummy, so Hubert lets him live and tells him to lay low for a while so John won't find out. When the English noblemen hear the ""news"" that Arthur is dead, they get all mad at King John for being a kid-killer and storm off to find the boy's grave. At this point, John gets some bad news: Louis, the Prince of France, is totally invading England. John starts freaking out until Hubert reveals that Arthur isn't actually dead. John is pretty overjoyed to hear that. He sends Hubert and the Bastard to find the nobles and tell them. Unfortunately, at that very moment, Arthur jumps off the wall of the tower and dies while trying to escape. The noblemen find his body and think he's been murdered by one of King John's henchmen. In their outrage, they decide to rebel and join forces with the French invaders. Now John has the following people ticked off at him: the Pope, his noblemen, and France. This is not good. In a tight spot, King John swears loyalty to the Pope because he wants the Church to have his back. As payback, Pandolf tells Louis to back down, but Louis refuses and proceeds to invade England. King John's forces go toe-to-toe with the French army and the English rebels, but nobody is really winning. Then, out of nowhere, King John starts feeling a little sick and leaves the battlefield to rest. Meanwhile, when the English rebels find out that Louis plans to betray them if he wins, they ditch him and join up with King John again. Good news, right? Not so fast, Shmoopers. It now turns out that King John has been... poisoned... by a treacherous monk. Gasp, right? John up and dies on us, leaving the throne of England to his son Henry . Prince Louis takes his army and heads home for France, supposedly because Pandolf has cut a deal with him. England is safe from a foreign threat... for now."
Henry VI Part 1,"Read the full text of Henry VI Part 1 with a side-by-side translation HERE. The play starts off on a cheerful note with the death of Henry V, who is one of England's greatest heroes partly because he conquered France. Just as the English nobles are wondering how England will ever survive, a messenger comes to say that the French are rebelling and doing pretty well at it, too. The English aristocrats make plans to fight the French and protect young King Henry VI's kingdom. He needs protecting because he's literally a baby. Already, there are some signs that the nobility may not be able to get along well enough to save the day. On top of all this, the French find a new champion, Joan of Arc. In some ways, she's more like Anakin Skywalker than Henry VI is. She comes from obscure origins , seems to have supernatural powers , and there's some ambiguity about whether she plans to use these powers for good. The French think she's a saint, which is a little bit like being a Jedi Knight, but the English think she's a witch, which in this culture is considered deeply dangerous, like being a Dark Jedi, or maybe even a Sith Lord. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the English nobility are fighting amongst themselves. Gloucester, the Lord Protector who's running the kingdom till Henry's old enough, has major conflicts with Winchester, who's sore because he thinks he doesn't get enough responsibility or respect. A young man named Richard quarrels with an aristocrat named Somerset. Richard is about to be restored to his noble title, Duke of York, which his father lost by getting executed for treason. Not pretty, that--especially since we soon find out that Richard's family may have a better claim to the throne than Henry VI. If you're wondering what happens there, Henry VI Part 2 can fill you in. For the meantime, York and Somerset are bickering. Henry VI makes it to France and is crowned king there, even though the English have lost a lot of France. It doesn't help that the quarrel between Richard and Somerset means they fail to get aid to Talbot, probably the strongest of the English military leaders, when he needs their help in a battle. He and his son die gloriously while fighting, but who's going to take their place? Eventually, peace negotiations are begun by third parties . The English agree, and Gloucester negotiates a politically advantageous marriage with a rich noblewoman. Henry's not so sure about marrying this young, but if it's good for the kingdom, why not? He agrees. Suffolk captures a woman named Margaret, whose father has some lands in France and is King of Naples. Suffolk thinks she's hot, but since he's already married he decides to try and set Margaret up with King Henry. Because that will end well. Suffolk convinces Henry to dump his fiancee for Margaret, but Margaret has no money and less advantageous political connections. Gloucester is unimpressed and worried this will cause major problems for the kingdom. The play ends with Suffolk hatching a plan: He'll have an affair with Margaret, and that will let him influence her, which will let him influence the king. Yep, that should go well."
Richard III,"Richard has just had his brother Clarence arrested and placed in the Tower of London. Using an order signed by their brother, King Edward, Richard has two murderers enter the Tower and stab Clarence to death. Richard also goes to speak with Lady Anne, whose father and husband he has helped murder. She curses him, but eventually is overcome by his smooth words. At the end of the scene Richard manages to get her to marry him. Queen Margaret, an old lady who haunts the court, casts a curse upon the royal assembly. She predicts that the current Queen Elizabeth's brother and sons will be killed, as will Lord Hastings, Buckingham, and lastly Richard. Her curse becomes the underlying plot of the play. King Edward, who is sick, tries to force his Queen's family to become friends with his noblemen. Richard enters the room and immediately destroys this tranquil scene by telling them that Clarence is dead. King Edward dies soon thereafter, leaving his son Prince Edward to inherit the throne. Richard wastes no time after the king's death. He immediately arrests Queen Elizabeth's brother and son, Rivers and Gray, and locks them in one of his castles. He also travel to where Prince Edward is staying, and helps the boy come back to London. Prince Edward goes to stay in the Tower, along with his younger brother. Richard calls for two councils, one of which is public and meant to put Edward on the throne, and one of which is private and meant to put Richard on the throne. He is aided by Buckingham throughout these scenes. Richard quickly puts Lord Hastings to death, because Hastings was unwilling to support Richard's attempt to seize the crown of England. With Buckingham helping him, Richard then orchestrates a neat scene in which he argues that Prince Edward is only a bastard. That would make Richard the next in line to the throne. The Lord Mayor of London agrees to this, and urges Richard to accept his duty. Richard pretends to reluctantly accept. King Richard the Third moves quickly to destroy anyone he suspects as being dangerous. His first act is to hire a murderer and kill Prince Edward and his brother. He also kills off his wife, Lady Anne, and attempts to marry the daughter of Queen Elizabeth. Buckingham, fearful for his life, runs away and builds an army to defend himself. Meanwhile, many of the remaining lieutenants defect to join Henry of Richmond. Henry of Richmond then sails from Brittany towards England with an army. Richard manages to capture Buckingham, and executes him for treason. He then takes his own army and goes to meet Henry of Richmond. The night before the battle, the ghosts of the people Richard has killed come into his dreams. They tell Richard that he will die, and inform Richmond that he will be victorious. Indeed, the next day Richard is killed and Henry is crowned King Henry VII of England."
Titus Andronicus,"The Roman emperor is dead, and his sons, Saturninus and Bassianus, are agitating over who will take over the position. Saturninus declares that it is his right by primogeniture, while Bassianus declares that he deserves the throne because he has greater merit. Their bickering is interrupted by the announcement that the Roman citizens have elected the general, Titus Andronicus, newly returned from a victorious war against the Goths, as their new emperor. On that note, Titus arrives bearing the bodies of his dead sons - of his original twenty-five he has lost twenty-one in battle - as well as his Goth prisoners. The prisoners include the queen of the Goths, Tamora, and her three sons: Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius. Titus orders that Alarbus be sacrificed as a gift to the Roman gods, despite the heartfelt pleading of Tamora that he spare her eldest son. He then entombs his sons and greets his daughter, Lavinia. Marcus, his brother, informs Titus that he has been made emperor. Titus, however, declines the honor and declares Saturninus emperor. Saturninus' first imperial act is to claim Lavinia for his bride, despite of the fact that Lavinia is betrothed to Bassianus. Titus agrees to the marriage, but Bassianus steals Lavinia from Saturninus' side, claiming his just right to her. When Titus' remaining sons and brother defend Bassianus' right as well, Titus is appalled and declares them traitors. He even kills one of his sons, Mutius, who stands up to him. Saturninus is aghast and blames Titus as well as his family for the loss of Lavinia; he is somewhat ameliorated, however, by the sight of Tamora, whom he is instantly smitten with and so marries instead. Thus made empress, Tamora begs Saturninus to forgive Titus and the Andronici, meanwhile secretly promising to have her revenge on them for the sacrifice of Alarbus. After their reconciliation, the Andronici and the emperor plan to hunt together the following day. Tamora has a Moorish lover, Aaron, whose chief joy in life is to devise villainous acts. He comes across Chiron and Demetrius arguing over which of them will woo Lavinia. Aaron suggests that during the scheduled hunt they both lead Lavinia to a secluded spot and rape her, and the boys agree. During the hunt, Aaron also plants a bag of money, planning to create further mayhem. He meets Tamora in the secluded spot he has chosen and they begin to behave amorously, only to be interrupted by Bassianus and Lavinia, who promise to report their tryst to Saturninus. Chiron and Demetrius enter before they can get away, and when Tamora tells her sons that Bassianus planned to kill her they stab him. They then prepare to rape Lavinia, who begs Tamora to intercede with her sons. Tamora, however, refuses. After dragging Bassianus' body to a hole that Aaron has scouted, they exit with Lavinia. Aaron meanwhile fetches two more of Titus' sons, telling them that a panther is in the hole. They fall in and discover Bassianus' body. Before they can get out, Aaron brings Saturninus and Titus to the scene. He produces a letter that ""proves"" that Titus' sons murdered Bassianus for the gold that he hid. Saturninus instantly orders their executions, despite Titus' plea for a trial. Chiron and Demetrius, in the meantime, have finished raping Lavinia. They mutilate her, cutting off her tongue and hands so that she cannot accuse her rapists, and leave her to be found by Marcus, who, after a long speech, brings her to her father. Titus has been pleading with the tribunes of Rome to give his sons a fair hearing, but to no avail. He is already miserable, and upon beholding his mutilated daughter he is horror-struck. Aaron arrives in the midst of his misery, claiming that the emperor will pardon Titus' sons if only one of the Andronici will chop off his hand and present it as a gift. While Marcus and Lucius search for an ax to chop off their hands, Titus has Aaron chop off his own. Aaron, however, soon returns with both his sons' heads and his hand. The Andronici woefully carry these body parts away. Some time later, Lavinia is able to indicate to Marcus and Titus, by referring to Ovid's tale of Philomel's rape, that she has been raped. With Marcus' help, she uses a tree branch to write the names of her rapists in the sand. Titus is spurred to revenge, and begins by sending Chiron and Demetrius weapons wrapped with verses from Horace. Aaron, meanwhile, learns that Tamora has given birth to his child. She sends the baby to him, ordering him to kill it, and Chiron and Demetrius try to do so themselves. Aaron protects his son, however, insisting that he will grow up to be heir to Rome. He kills the nurse and midwife who witnessed the birth and, in order to fool Saturninus, has Chiron and Demetrius fetch a white infant to be presented as his son. He then escapes with his son to the Goths outside of Rome, hoping to find a safe home for him. The Andronici, meanwhile, have taken to shooting arrows wrapped in letters to the gods begging for justice into the Imperial court. Saturninus is infuriated at the suggestion that justice is not to be found in Rome, and is also worried because Lucius, whom he banished, has raised an army of Goths to depose him and has the support of the Roman people. Tamora reassures her husband that she will take care of Titus. She plans a banquet with Titus, Lucius, and the imperial family, to be held at Titus' house. During his attempt to save his son, Aaron is captured by the Goths and taken to Lucius. Lucius is about to kill them both when Aaron strikes a bargain with him to let the baby live in exchange for a full confession of his crimes. He tells Lucius about the rape of Lavinia, the murder of Bassianus, and the many other heinous acts that he gleefully committed. Lucius, horrified by his tales, has him bound and gagged. Tamora arrives at Titus' house to enact her plan. She comes dressed as the goddess Revenge, hoping that Titus is maddened enough by his misery to blind him to her true identity. Her sons also come in costume, as Rape and Murder. Titus, at their bidding, agrees to hold the banquet at his house and sends Revenge off to smite his enemies. He orders Revenge to leave Rape and Murder behind, however, and when Tamora is gone he reveals that he recognized them all along. He and Lavinia cooperate to murder Chiron and Demetrius, and hatch a plan to bake their flesh and blood into meat pies and serve them at the coming banquet. The night of the banquet arrives, and Saturninus and Tamora eat the pies. Titus asks Saturninus whether the father of a raped woman should kill her, and Saturninus says that yes, he should. At that, Titus kills Lavinia, revealing that Chiron and Demetrius raped and mutilated her at the bidding of Tamora and Aaron. Titus then stabs Tamora, Saturninus stabs Titus, and Marcus stabs Saturninus. With the emperor and Titus dead, the Romans agree to elect Lucius emperor. Lucius orders that Saturninus and Titus be buried, that Tamora be left to scavengers, and that Aaron be buried up to the chest in the ground and left to starve to death."
The Two Gentlemen of Verona,"When the play opens, Valentine and Proteus are in the middle of an emotional goodbye. You see, Valentine is leaving for Milan and his BFF is sad to see him go. Proteus would join him on his adventure, but he's in love with Julia so he's decided to stay home in Verona to be with her.Meanwhile, Julia is hanging out with her woman in waiting, Lucetta. The two discuss which one of popular Julia's suitors is the dreamiest. Julia is partial to Proteus, but he's the only guy who hasn't proposed to her yet. As Julia wonders why that is, Lucetta whips out a letter from Proteus and hands it over to Julia, who pretends she's too modest to read it. After a silly little game of ""I don't want to read it, send it back,"" Julia demands the love note and then tears it to shreds when Lucetta teases her. She immediately regrets it and tries to piece it back together.Meanwhile, when Proteus's dad hears that people have been talking trash about him for not sending his son to travel abroad , he decides to send Proteus to Milan, where he can become a well-rounded person . Proteus tries to waffle - he was hoping to spend his summer going to the beach and hanging out at Dairy Queen with his girl Julia, but his dad won't let him wriggle out of traveling abroad. Proteus visits Julia one last time - they exchange rings and she cries. Then Proteus heads to Milan, where Valentine has been hanging out.Speaking of Valentine...in Milan, he has met and fallen in love with the beautiful and sassy Silvia. Silvia treats Valentine like her ""servant"" and Valentine loves every minute of it. When Proteus shows up, he promptly falls in love with Silvia, forgetting all about the girl he left back home. Then Proteus does something awful - he tattles on Valentine to Silvia's protective father, the Duke of Milan. When the Duke approaches Valentine, a steamy lover letter to Silvia and a rope ladder fall out of the young man's jacket. The Duke says something like ""Aha! You're planning to climb that ladder up to my daughter's bedroom. Get out of my sight."" Ultimately, the Duke banishes Valentine from Milan - if Valentine shows his face in town ever again, he'll be put to death.Meanwhile, back in Verona, Julia has decided she's going to travel to Milan to find her beloved Proteus. She dresses like a boy so she can travel without being accosted by any ""lascivious men"" who would try to ravish her. Julia gets gussied up in a pair of ""breeches"" and a fancy codpiece and heads to Milan, where she discovers her beloved Proteus...hitting on Silvia.While this is happening, our boy Valentine is riding through a forest somewhere between Milan and Mantua when a band of outlaws pounce on him. Valentine lies about having killed a man and the outlaws are totally impressed. They decide he should be the Robin Hood to their band of merry thieves, so they invite him to be the leader of their forest dwelling gang. Valentine agrees to live with them in the forest but makes them promise not to hurt any ""silly women"" or helpless travelers.Back in Milan, Julia is calling herself ""Sebastian"" and has landed a job as Proteus's errand boy. When Proteus sends ""Sebastian"" to deliver a ring to Silvia, ""Sebastian"" and Silvia get to talking. Silvia refuses to take the ring because she knows it once belonged to Julia. Julia admits to the audience that this is a good thing because she would have ""scratched out"" Silvia's eyes if she wasn't such a nice person.Silvia is still in love with banished Valentine, so she convinces her good friend Eglamour to help her find him - the two run off to the forest, where Silvia is kidnapped by the outlaws, who proceed to take her to their leader, Valentine. Meanwhile, the Duke has learned his daughter ran away and has organized a posse to track her down in the forest.

When she refuses to love him, he tries to rape her. Before Proteus can assault Silvia, however, Valentine steps in and...yells at Proteus for betraying their friendship. Proteus says he's sorry for being a lousy friend and Valentine says, ""All that was mine in Silvia I give thee"" . There are a few ways to read this but you'll have to go to ""What's Up with the Ending?"" if you want to know what we think...Before Proteus can respond, ""Sebastian"" faints dramatically and then reveals that ""he"" is actually Julia. Proteus takes one look at his former girlfriend and falls back in love with her. Julia forgives Proteus and the two are engaged. The Duke, who has also arrived in the forest, decides that Valentine is a great guy after all, so he gives his daughter to him as a ""gift."" Valentine thinks this is just swell. Valentine suggests a double wedding is in order and the crew heads back to the Duke's place for a big reception."
Second Treatise of Government,"In the Second Treatise of Government, John Locke discusses men's move from a state of nature characterized by perfect freedom and governed by reason to a civil government in which the authority is vested in a legislative and executive power. The major ideas developed throughout the text include popular sovereignty and the consent of the governed, the protection and limitations of property, the problems inherent in an absolute monarchy, and the ability of a people to dissolve their government if it does not adhere to the bond of trust established between the governed and governor. The Treatise begins with a discussion of the state of nature. In this state, men are born equal to one another and have perfect liberty to maintain and order their lives and property. They are governed by reason and seek the preservation of mankind. When a man transgresses the laws of nature and uses force against another, the entire society has the right to punish him in order to preserve order and make an example of him to deter future crimes. The state of nature is entirely free but men find that other men may interfere with their ability to protect their property. A state of war exists when one man uses force against another. It can only be lifted when the aggressor is killed or reparations are made. In terms of slavery, Locke states that it is only just for a man to be enslaved when he forfeits his life due to his usage of force against his conqueror. It is not just for any man to exercise absolute or arbitrary power over another. Absolute monarchs who do so are guilty of creating a state of war between themselves and their subjects. The desire to protect one's property is paramount in establishing a civil government. Property includes a man's life, liberty, and possessions. In a state of nature, man's property is directly correlated to the labor he puts into it. Any land he cultivates can be considered his property, as well as any fruits of the earth that he picks. As populations grow and societies establish currencies, a government is needed to regulate property. Civil government is established when the people consent to be governed. They cannot be forced into allegiance or fealty to a government. The people give up their rights to perfect freedom, judgment, and punishment, and invest these powers in a legislative and executive power. Locke does not believe democracy is the only type of valid government, but he does firmly state that absolute monarchies are completely at odds with civil society because the ruler has no limitations on his power. The civil government is based upon the bond of trust between the people and their authority. The people gave up their freedom, and in turn, they expect the authority to act with the public good always in mind. Any breach of this bond of trust can legitimate the people's dissolution of the government. The civil society has a legislative and executive power. The legislative power is the supreme law of the land; its standing laws must be known and followed. The executive power enforces the laws of the legislature and exercises the power of prerogative, which is the ability to use discretion to enforce the public good even if the laws must be circumvented or ignored. If the legislative or executive powers act arbitrarily, erratically, or simply not at all, they are violating the bond of trust with the people and forsaking their claim to obedience and submission. If, after a prolonged series of oppressive maneuvers and unheard appeals, the people still have no respite from the tyrannical actions of their government, they have the right to dissolve said government. They can restore it with new leadership, change it, or create an entirely new system of government. A government only exists when it has the consent of the people, and thus, can be dissolved when it has failed them."
She Stoops to Conquer,"She Stoops to Conquer opens with a prologue in which an actor mourns the death of the classical low comedy at the altar of sentimental, ""mawkish"" comedy. He hopes that Dr. Goldsmith can remedy this problem through the play about to be presented. Act I is full of set-up for the rest of the play. Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle live in an old house that resembles an inn, and they are waiting for the arrival of Marlow, son of Mr. Hardcastle's old friend and a possible suitor to his daughter Kate. Kate is very close to her father, so much so that she dresses plainly in the evenings and fancifully in the mornings for her friends. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hardcastle's niece Constance is in the old woman's care, and has her small inheritance held until she is married, hopefully to Mrs. Hardcastle's spoiled son from an earlier marriage, Tony Lumpkin. The problem is that neither Tony nor Constance loves the other, and in fact Constance has a beloved, who will be traveling to the house that night with Marlow. Tony's problem is also that he is a drunk and a lover of low living, which he shows when the play shifts to a pub nearby. When Marlow and Hastings arrive at the pub, lost on the way to Hardcastle's, Tony plays a practical joke by telling the two men that there is no room at the pub and that they can find lodging at the old inn down the road . Act II sees the plot get complicated. When Marlow and Hastings arrive, they are impertinent and rude with Hardcastle, whom they think is a landlord and not a host . Hardcastle expects Marlow to be a polite young man, and is shocked at the behavior. Constance finds Hastings, and reveals to him that Tony must have played a trick. However, they decide to keep the truth from Marlow, because they think revealing it will upset him and ruin the trip. They decide they will try to get her jewels and elope together. Marlow has a bizarre tendency to speak with exaggerated timidity to ""modest"" women, while speaking in lively and hearty tones to women of low-class. When he has his first meeting with Kate, she is dressed well, and hence drives him into a debilitating stupor because of his inability to speak to modest women. She is nevertheless attracted to him, and decides to try and draw out his true character. Tony and Hastings decide together that Tony will steal the jewels for Hastings and Constance, so that he can be rid of his mother's pressure to marry Constance, whom he doesn't love. Act III opens with Hardcastle and Kate each confused with the side of Marlow they saw. Where Hardcastle is shocked at his impertinence, Kate is disappointed to have seen only modesty. Kate asks her father for the chance to show him that Marlow is more than both believe. Tony has stolen the jewels, but Constance doesn't know and continues to beg her aunt for them. Tony convinces Mrs. Hardcastle to pretend they were stolen to dissuade Constance, a plea she willingly accepts until she realizes they have actually been stolen. Meanwhile, Kate is now dressed in her plain dress and is mistaken by Marlow as a barmaid to whom he is attracted. She decides to play the part, and they have a lively, fun conversation that ends with him trying to embrace her, a move Mr. Hardcastle observes. Kate asks for the night to prove that he can be both respectful and lively. Act IV finds the plots almost falling apart. News has spread that Sir Charles Marlow is on his way, which will reveal Hastings's identity as beloved of Constance and also force the question of whether Kate and Marlow are to marry. Hastings has sent the jewels in a casket to Marlow for safekeeping but Marlow, confused, has given them to Mrs. Hardcastle . When Hastings learns this, he realizes his plan to elope with wealth is over, and decides he must convince Constance to elope immediately. Meanwhile, Marlow's impertinence towards Hardcastle reaches its apex, and Hardcastle kicks him out of the house, during which altercation Marlow begins to realize what is actually happening. He finds Kate, who now pretends to be a poor relation to the Hardcastles, which would make her a proper match as far as class but not a good marriage as far as wealth. Marlow is starting to love her, but cannot pursue it because it would be unacceptable to his father because of her lack of weatlh, so he leaves her. Meanwhile, a letter from Hastings arrives that Mrs. Hardcastle intercepts, and she reads that he waits for Constance in the garden, ready to elope. Angry, she insists that she will bring Constance far away, and makes plans for that. Marlow, Hastings and Tony confront one another, and the anger over all the deceit leads to a severe argument, resolved temporarily when Tony promises to solve the problem for Hastings. Act V finds the truth coming to light, and everyone happy. Sir Charles has arrived, and he and Hastings laugh together over the confusion young Marlow was in. Marlow arrives to apologize, and in the discussion over Kate, claims he barely talked to Kate. Hardcastle accuses him of lying, since Hardcastle saw him embrace Kate . Kate arrives after Marlow leaves the room and convinces the older men she will reveal the full truth if they watch an interview between the two from a hidden vantage behind a screen. Meanwhile, Hastings waits in the garden, per Tony's instruction, and Tony arrives to tell him that he drove his mother and Constance all over in circles, so that they think they are lost far from home when in fact they have been left nearby. Mrs. Hardcastle, distraught, arrives and is convinced she must hide from a highwayman who is approaching. The ""highwayman"" proves to be Mr. Hardcastle, who scares her in her confusion for a while but ultimately discovers what is happening. Hastings and Constance, nearby, decide they will not elope but rather appeal to Mr. Hardcastle for mercy. Back at the house, the interview between Kate and Marlow reveals his truly good character, and after some discussion, everyone agrees to the match. Hastings and Constance ask permission to marry and, since Tony is actually of age and therefore can of his own volition decide not to marry Constance, the permission is granted. All are happy , and the ""mistakes of a night"" have been corrected. There are two epilogues generally printed to the play, one of which sketches in metaphor Goldsmith's attempt to bring comedy back to its traditional roots, and the other of which suggests Tony Lumpkin has adventures yet to be realized."
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"Dorothy lived with her hardworking but dour Uncle Henry and Aunt Em on the bleak Kansas prairie. She was an energetic and joyful little girl who delighted in her small dog, Toto. One day a dangerous cyclone swept across the prairie. Toto hid under the bed in the farmhouse, so Dorothy did not make it into the storm cellar. The cyclone picked up the house with Dorothy and Toto still inside. As the hours passed, Dorothy tried to remain calm and eventually fell asleep. When she awoke she and Toto were in a fantastical and strange land. Coming out of the house, she and Toto were met by a few small men that called themselves Munchkins and the elderly but beautiful Witch of the North. The Witch informed Dorothy that her house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East and killed her, thus setting the Munchkins free from their long slavery under her command. Dorothy was horrified to hear that she had killed someone, but she was given a present of the Witch's silver slippers. She asked how she could get home and the Witch told her she would do best to ask the powerful Wizard of Oz who lived in the Emerald City. Dorothy's journey on the yellow brick road that led to the Emerald City began in the pretty and well-tilled land of the Munchkins. Passing a field, she encountered The Scarecrow, whom she released from his position held aloft in the field. He told her he wanted brains and asked if he could go with her to visit the Wizard. She happily agreed and the two companions continued along the yellow brick road to Oz. They helped save The Tin Woodman, who had rusted in the forest while cutting down a tree. He joined them, hoping to ask the Wizard for his dearest wish - a heart. They also met The Cowardly Lion, who, after roaring at them loudly, sheepishly admitted he had no courage and wanted to ask Oz to grant him some so he could be a real King of Beasts. The travelers continued along their path and faced several obstacles. They found a large ditch in their path and had the Lion jump over it with his friends on his back. They arrived at a field full of beautiful but deadly poppies; Dorothy and Toto and even the Lion fell into a deep sleep. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman carried out Dorothy and Toto but received the help of thousands of field mice in carrying out the Lion. When they finally arrived at Oz, the Guardian at the Gate of the sparkling green city was surprised to hear that they wanted to see Oz, as no one had requested a visit for many years. They were told they could see Oz one by one in his throne room on separate days. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Lion each encountered a different Oz - a massive head, a beautiful woman, a frightening creature, and a ball of fire - and were all told that the Wicked Witch of the West must be killed before their wishes would be granted. Despondent but realizing there was no other way, the companions set out once more. Their journey was beset by danger because the powerful Witch knew that they were coming. She tried to destroy them with various minions - forty wolves, crows and black bees - but each swarm was defeated. Finally, the Witch sent the Winged Monkeys after the travelers. The Monkeys were bound to the Golden Cap, which said that its owner could command them to do whatever he or she wanted three times. The Witch commanded them to destroy the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow and bring her Dorothy and the Lion. Dorothy, who she could not harm since the Good Witch of the North had given her a mark of protection, was made to work in the Witch's kitchen. The Lion was chained up when he refused to toil for her. One day the Witch noticed Dorothy's silver slippers, and realizing their secret power, tried to trip Dorothy so they would fall off of her feet. This angered Dorothy and she threw a pail of water on the Witch. To her shock, the water melted the Witch and Dorothy was free. This was heartening to those in the Witch's land whom she had enslaved - the Winkies. Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion left the Witch's castle, and, taking control of the Golden Cap, commanded the Monkeys to take them to Emerald City. To their dismay, when they arrived in the Emerald City the Wizard claimed he could not help them. The Lion roared loudly in anger, scaring Toto and sending him tumbling into a curtain. This revealed a small and elderly old man. He was a mere ventriloquist and balloonist from Omaha who had accidentally ended up in Oz when the wind took his balloon far away from home. The Munchkins thought he was a powerful Wizard, and while not a cruel man, he went along with the delusion. They built the Emerald City and lived happily under the Wizard's rule. He told them to rid of the Witch since she had real power and frightened him. After telling his story and apologizing for his trickery, he said he would try to help them anyway. With a bit of goodhearted manipulation, he gave the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion what they wanted, noting that each had displayed what they thought they lacked on the journey. His plan for Dorothy was to fly away over the desert borders of Oz in his balloon. He planned on going as well, but just as they were about to depart, Toto distracted Dorothy and she missed the balloon. It sailed away in the sky and she cried out in sadness. She tried to ask the Winged Monkeys in her second command to take her to Kansas, but they said they could not travel beyond the borders of Oz. A soldier in the Emerald City suggested she travel to the home of the Good Witch of the South, Glinda. This seemed a valid plan and Dorothy set out once more, accompanied by her friends. Together they faced more curious and dangerous creatures - people made of china, the devious Hammer-Heads, and the beasts of the forest who later crowned the Lion as their king. Their journey was not easy but they finally made it to the lovely Glinda's castle. She said she did not need to help Dorothy because the girl's silver shoes possessed that power: she merely had to click her heels together three times and say where she wanted to go and she would be there. In exchange for her help, Dorothy gave her the Golden Cap, and she used the three commands to send the Scarecrow back to rule over the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman to rule over the Winkies, and the Lion to rule over the beasts in the forest. She then gave the Cap to the Monkeys and set them free from their bondage. Dorothy kissed her friends goodbye and wished them well, and then clicked her heels together and said ""Take me home to Aunt Em!"" She ended up in the Kansas prairie, the silver shoes having fallen off in the desert. She ran towards her Aunt Em who was astonished to see her and asked her where she had been. Dorothy replied she had been in Oz and was glad to be home."
Pygmalion,"In Covent Garden, the Eynsford Hills wait for a cab in the rain. When Freddy goes to hail one, he knocks Liza's flowers out of her basket. She accepts money from Freddy's mother, then Colonel Pickering. A bystander warns her that a man is writing down what she is saying, and she confronts him, saying that she has done nothing wrong. Higgins amazes the crowd by imitating her accent and guessing where they all come from. Pickering and Higgins meet and agree to have dinner, and Higgins fills Liza's basket with money before he leaves. Liza leaves in a cab. The next day, Liza intrudes upon Pickering and Higgins in Higgins's home. She wants English lessons, and Pickering bets that Higgins could not pass her off as a lady at the ambassador's ball in a month's time. Mrs. Pearce takes Liza away to bathe her and dress her more appropriately, and Liza's father arrives and demands some payment. Higgins likes him and gives him five pounds. A few months later, Mrs. Higgins is writing letters at home when she is interrupted by her son, who shocks her by telling her that he is bringing a flower-girl to his house. The Eynsford Hills arrive for a visit, as does Eliza--with her newly elegant accent and manner. Freddy is infatuated right away. Eliza makes the mistake of swearing and describing her aunt's alcoholism, and she is hustled away by Higgins. Clara thinks that swearing is the new fashion and shocks her mother by saying ""bloody"" on the way out. Mrs. Higgins scolds Pickering and her son for not considering what is to be done with Eliza after the experiment. At midnight at Higgins's house, Eliza enters looking exhausted. Higgins ignores her, looking for his slippers and crowing over her success at fooling everyone as his own. Eliza begins to look furious. When Higgins asks where his slippers are, Eliza throws them at his face. She explains that she does not know what to do with herself now that Higgins has transformed her. He suggests that she marry, to which she responds that she used to be something better than a prostitute when she sold flowers. She throws the ring that he gave her into the fireplace, and he loses his temper at her and leaves the room. She looks for the ring in the ashes. Mrs. Higgins is in her drawing room when her son comes and tells her that Eliza has run away. Doolittle arrives and announces that after he spoke with Higgins, Higgins recommended him as a speaker to an American millionaire who died and left him everything. Doolittle is now middle-class and hating every minute of it; his mistress is forcing him to marry her that afternoon. Eliza comes downstairs , and Higgins looks flabbergasted. Doolittle invites Pickering and Mrs. Higgins to the wedding, and they leave Eliza and Higgins alone to talk. Eliza says that she does not want to be treated like a pair of slippers--and Freddy writes her love letters every day. When she threatens to become a phonetics teacher herself and use Higgins's methods, he says that he likes the new, stronger version of Eliza. He wants to live with her and Pickering as ""three bachelors."" Mrs. Higgins returns dressed for the wedding, and she takes Eliza with her. Higgins asks her to run his errands for him, including that of buying some cheese and ham. She says a final goodbye to him, and he seems confident that she will follow his command. The onstage drama ends, and Shaw narrates, in an epilogue, that Eliza recognizes Higgins as predestined to be a bachelor; she marries Freddy instead. With a gift from Colonel Pickering, Eliza opens a flower shop. The only person truly bothered by this state of affairs is Clara, who decides that the marriage will not help her own marriage prospects. But then she begins to read H.G. Wells and travel in the circles of his fans, and she is convinced to begin working in a furniture shop herself in the hopes that she might meet Wells . Freddy is not very practical, and he and Eliza must take classes in bookkeeping to make their business a success. They do reach success, and they live a fairly comfortable life."
The Boxcar Children,"As our story opens, four hungry children stand outside a bakery eyeing the cakes. No one knows who they are or what they are doing--or, at least, the baker's wife doesn't know these things because the mysterious children refuse to give her any info. After talking the baker's wife into giving them a place to sleep that night, the kids sit down for a dinner of bread and ... more bread. As it turns out, the children are brothers and sisters: Henry , Jessie , Violet , and Benny . Their parents are dead, and the Alden children are on the run from a mean grandfather they've never met, and that's literally all we ever find out about their background. So far, the running away isn't going all that well, though: When Henry and Jessie overhear the baker's wife say she plans to put them to work and ship Benny off to the Children's Home the next day, they flee into the darkness. They spend the next few days walking all night and sleeping during the day. After spending a night sleeping in the woods, a nasty storm drives Jessie to seek shelter. She finds an abandoned boxcar, and the kids like it so much that they decide to make it their home. They don't have much in the way of worldly possessions--just $4, a few towels, and a couple of other small items--but they manage to turn the boxcar into a sweet crib. They scavenge dishes from the dump, and Henry builds a swimming pool. They even get a dog, Watch, who joins the family after Jessie pulls a thorn out of his paw. They're like the perfect American family, assuming you're willing to overlook the whole ""runaway orphan"" thing. Henry finds a job in town working for a local doctor. While he toils during the day, Jessie takes care of the shorties and plans the menu. Dr. Moore keeps Henry pretty busy. Though he's more than satisfied with Henry's work, the doctor is curious about what Henry's whole deal is. So, he secretly follows him back to the boxcar--yikes--and then he secretly returns two more times to get further info on the kids, once in the middle of the night and once while all of the kids are at his house picking cherries. At some point along the way, Dr. Moore realizes that the children's grandfather is Mr. Alden, the neighboring town's resident billionaire. For no real reason, he decides to keep this info to himself. Meanwhile, life in the boxcar is going great until Violet gets sick. Henry seeks help from Dr. Moore, who takes them all back to his place while Violet recovers. The morning after the kids move into Dr. Moore's house, Mr. Alden turns up. Mr. Alden knows the kids are afraid of their grandfather, so the plan is that Mr. Alden will win them over without revealing his true identity. The plan totally works, and by the time the kids figure out who Mr. A. is, they already trust him, so everything's cool. After Violet recovers, they all move into his super fancy mansion and live happily ever after with their beloved boxcar, which Mr. Alden parks in one of his gardens."
The Piazza Tales,"Our narrator--who is sort of an analogue of Melville--buys a house in Massachusetts . The narrator wants a piazza on it, but doesn't have one. So he gets a porch built. Then he sits on the porch and looks out over the landscape. He has a daydream about going out into the mountains and meeting an isolated woman named Marianna, who is lonely, and looks at his house from afar and imagines he's happy. Then the daydream ends and he's back on his porch, feeling sorry for himself. Every person who has ever read this story has wished he or she could fly out on fairy dust into the mountains, find Melville's sweet, fragrant house, and give Melville a swift kick in the pants. The narrator, a lawyer, hires a new copyist named Bartleby. Bartleby is a good, quick copyist, but whenever asked to do something out of the way of his usual duties, he says, ""I prefer not to."" The narrator, confronted with this rank insubordination, does nothing--and soon Bartleby is living in the offices and refusing to copy anything or do anything except stare at the wall. You could almost turn this into a how-not-to-manage course. The narrator takes a firm stand and fires Bartleby. Bartleby just stays there. Driven to extreme measures, the narrator decides to move his offices altogether, leaving Bartleby behind. The person who takes the offices is a lot less forgiving than the narrator, and calls the police, who take Bartleby to prison as a vagrant. The narrator visits him there once...and then on the second visit, Bartleby has starved himself to death. The narrator feels bad for Bartleby, and for all of humanity. Or, shorter version: Bartleby does nothing, with surprising stubbornness, until he manages to arrange matters so he need never do nothing again. ""Benito Cereno"" is based on a true story; it's adapted from Amasa Delano's Narrative of Voyages and Travels, though Melville fiddled with it a bit. In Melville's version, Captain Amasa Delano is sailing off of Chile in his ship The Bachelor's Delight when he comes upon a floating Spanish ship, the San Dominick, commanded by Don Benito Cereno. The ship has been wrecked, becalmed, and wracked with fever and scurvy--it's a hot mess. Many men have died, though many of the black slaves have survived, and are all on deck. Delano comes onboard to offer water, food, and provisions to Don Benito, who seems ill and weird, but is luckily supported by his trusty servant, Babo. But, actually, all of that is completely false In truth, the ship was taken over in mid-voyage by the slaves, led by Babo. Everything's a mess because lots of sailors were killed in the revolt and supplies were lost as well. Cereno isn't ill and weird; he's terrified. Babo makes him pretend like he's still in command, but if he makes a misstep, or Delano suspects anything, Babo will kill Cereno, and Delano too. So, does Delano suspect? He goes back and forth; he thinks something seems odd, but then he can't figure out what. He is not the brightest pencil in the sea--and also, he's racist, so he can't imagine that the black people would be smart enough to pull something like this off. Babo actually hoped to take over Delano's ship...but at the last minute, Cereno leaps into Delano's boat as it pulls away, and the whole plot is uncovered. The slaves don't have any firearms, and though they fight valiantly, the Americans eventually take the ship, kill many of the black people, and capture the rest. In the process, they kill several of the remaining Spanish sailors by accident. Whoops. So the blacks, including Babo, are executed; Cereno himself dies not too long afterwards of shock and general unhappiness. Babo's head is stuck on a pike. Delano, the dumb-as-a-post American, lives on. Let freedom ring. During a terrible thunderstorm, the narrator hears a knock on the door. A lightning-rod salesman comes in. He tries to warn the narrator that he's going to be fried to a burnt crisp by a lightning strike if he doesn't buy a lightning rod. The narrator sneers at him, the lightning-rod guy attacks, the narrator overpowers him and kicks him out. The end. Seriously, that's it. That's all that happens. Melville just wanted to write a story about how he hates door-to-door salesman. And who can blame him? This isn't really a short piece of fiction. Instead, it's a piece of travel writing about the Encantadas, or the Galapagos. As such, it's mostly description, with some amusing anecdotes tossed in. The main point of the piece is that the Encantadas are isolated, dry, lonely, and awful. Also, there are turtles. In terms of the anecdotes Melville tells, there's one story about a Creole who ruled Charles's island, but was overthrown because he was mean, leaving the lawless rioters to enjoy the place by themselves. There's also a story about Hunilla, a woman who went to an island to turtle hunt with her brother and husband, was stranded, and then got rescued. And there's a story about the hermit Oberlus, who attacked people, enslaved a handful, escaped his island, and eventually got thrown in prison. And that's about it for plot. The story also has a lot of quotes from Edmund Spenser's The Fairie Queen, because The Fairie Queen is about fairies, and the islands are called ""The Enchanted Islands"". Get it? Bannadonna, an ambitious, perhaps mad architect, decides to build a gigantic bell-tower. While forging the bell, he gets angry at a workman, and bashes him to death with a ladle. No one cares, because workmen are a dime a dozen, and there is only one Bannadonna. What they don't know, though, is that a piece of ladle got off, went into the bell, and caused a flaw, which Bannadonna covers up because he's a jerk as well as a murderer. Bannadonna then makes some secret mechanism, which he won't disclose to anyone, not even the chief magistrate, who comes calling at the belfry. On the day the bell is to be rung, nothing happens. The townspeople go up to the belfry, and find that Bannadonna has been killed by his human-like mechanism, which was supposed to bash the bell, but instead bashed Bannadonna by accident. At Bannadonna's funeral, the bell is rung, but because of the flaw it breaks. Then a year later there's an earthquake and the tower itself falls. The moral of the story? Don't be a prideful, murderous jerk like Bannadonna. Or maybe don't get caught in a mediocre gothic story by Melville; take your pick."
The Return of Sherlock Holmes,"Holmes dramatically returns from the dead, or from being presumed dead. He's not a zombie. He and Watson reunite to take down a would-be assassin of Holmes, and murderer of Ronald Adair, Colonel Moran. With Moran in jail Holmes can now safely return to London and resume his detective business. A young man named John Hector McFarlane is falsely accused of murdering Jonas Oldacre. Despite his protestations of innocence, there's no evidence to be found in his defense. Until Holmes takes the case, of course. By using some forensic science and staging a fake fire, Holmes is able to flush Oldacre out of hiding. Oldacre tried to revenge himself upon McFarlane's parents by faking his death and framing McFarlane. This one is not nearly as fun as it sounds, alas. Watson and Holmes do not go clubbing. They do, however, stop a man from stalking a woman. Hilton Cubitt hires Holmes to help him find out who has been sending him weird encoded messages that are freaking out his wife. Holmes cracks the code, but arrives too late to prevent the death of Hilton and the attempted suicide of his wife. Who sent the messages and killed Hilton?

A woman named Violet Smith has had some weird things happen to her lately, and she hires Holmes and Watson to get to the bottom of things. Violet recently came in contact with two friends of her deceased uncle. One of the men, Mr. Woodley, is sleazy; the other, Mr. Carruthers, hires Violet as a governess and then proposes to her. Poor Violet is already engaged and wants them to leave her alone. She also has a strange guy following her on her bike when she rides to the train-station after work. Holmes connects it all together and arrives in time to save Violet after she's kidnapped by Mr. Woodley. Turns out Violet inherited a lot of money from her dead uncle and Woodley wanted to marry her so he could get it. Carruthers was in on the scheme, but ended up genuinely falling for Violet. He was also the mystery biker who tried to protect her from Woodley. A young heir goes missing from a fancy boarding school, and the head of the school hires Holmes and Watson to find him. During their search they find a missing professor dead and fear for the boy's safety. Their search leads them back around to the boy's own father, the Duke of Holdernesse, and his secretary James Wilder. When confronted, the Duke makes a shocking confession. James Wilder is no secretary at all, but the Duke's illegitimate son. The supposed secretary hired a man named Reuben Hayes, to help him kidnap his younger half-brother in an effort to force his dad into making him a legitimate heir. The young boy is recovered safely and is reunited with his parents. A ship captain named Peter Carey is found dead, stabbed through with a harpoon. Ouch. A police inspector named Stanley Hopkins brings Holmes the case; Hopkins is being mentored by Holmes. Peter Carey was an abusive jerk, so it's not surprising that he has enemies; but his murder is a total mystery. After a stakeout, Holmes, Watson, and Hopkins catch a guy named Neligan returning to the scene of the crime to retrieve some incriminating evidence. He swears he didn't kill Peter though and Holmes believes him. After some more investigating, Holmes catches the real killer: Peter's old first mate, Patrick Cains, who was trying to get in on a financial scheme that Peter had going. Milverton is a notorious blackmailer who has ruined lots of people and caused many more grief. Holmes is hired by a lady who is being blackmailed by Milverton, and Holmes is determined to stop this guy once and for all. But Milverton is very crafty and Holmes can't get anything on him. Finally, Holmes and Watson break into Milverton's house in an effort to get the incriminating letters back for their client. While there, they end up witnessing Milverton's murder by an angry mystery woman. The two hide what they know from the cops and never reveal the identity of Milverton's killer. No, Napoleon wasn't cloned here. Though that would be pretty awesome/weird. There's someone going around London busting statues of Napoleon. But what starts off as a weird nuisance quickly turns deadly after a statue owner finds a dead guy on his doorstep and a broken statue outside. Holmes figures out that the statues were all made by the same person, and he connects the dots back to an Italian named Beppo, who hid something in one of the statues. After catching Beppo, Holmes buys the last Napoleon statue and busts it open himself, revealing a famous pearl hidden inside. While doing some research in a university town, a professor approaches Holmes and Watson for help. The professor is going to administer a scholarship exam in Greek the next day, and he says that someone has broken into his rooms and seen - maybe even copied - the exam. It's a cheating scandal! Holmes narrows down the suspects to three students who live nearby. He stages a trap for Gilchrist, the least likely suspect. Gilchrist confesses and says he's leaving school to get a job. Scandal averted. A young rugby player named Cyril Overton barges in on Holmes and Watson and asks for help finding his missing teammate before their big game. The missing teammate is Godfrey Staunton and he disappeared with an older guy after sending a mysterious telegram. Holmes tracks him to a nearby area but is stonewalled by a Dr. Armstrong, who is protecting Staunton. Holmes finally figures out his location and discovers that Staunton was secretly married, and that his wife had fallen ill and recently died. Dr. Armstrong was a friend and tried to protect the young couple from scrutiny. Holmes and Watson leave the grieving Godfrey in peace and return home. Stanley Hopkins returns again and gets Holmes and Watson to help him out on a home invasion/murder case. A woman named Mary Frasier, wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall, witnessed her husband's murder. She says a gang of men broke into their home, killed her husband, tied her up, and stole some silver dishes. It all seems like a clear-cut case, but Holmes's gut tells him otherwise. After some digging he realizes Mary Frasier is lying and confronts her with evidence that a man named Jack Crocker was involved. Jack confesses all. Turns out Sir Eustace was an abusive husband and that Jack and Mary were really in love. Jack came to see Mary and was confronted by Sir Eustace, whom he killed in self-defense. Afterwards, Jack, Mary, and her maid Theresa covered up the crime. Holmes agrees that Jack was justified and lets him go without reporting it to the police. Watson and Holmes are hired by the Prime Minister, Lord Bellinger, and the European Secretary, Trelawney Hope, to help recover a stolen political document. If the document gets into the wrong hands, it could spark a war. Holmes and Watson track the document to a spy named Eduardo Lucas, who has recently been murdered by his wife, who actually was married to one of his assumed identities. After some digging, Holmes realizes that Trelawney Hope's wife has the letter. She was being blackmailed and delivered the letter to Eduardo, not realizing the trouble she would cause. After his murder she stole the letter back. Holmes quickly puts it back where it belongs, and the crisis is averted."
Arms and the Man,"The play unfolds in Bulgaria in 1885, towards the end of the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Raina Petkoff and her mother Catherine have received news that Raina's fiance Sergius led a victorious cavalry charge against Serbian forces. Louka, the household maid, enters to announce that the windows must be locked, as fleeing Serbian troops are being hunted down in the streets. Later that night a Serbian officer climbs the drainpipe outside Raina's balcony and breaks into her room. Bulgarian soldiers arrive, asking to inspect the room, and Raina, overwhelmed by a moment of compassion, hides the enemy soldier behind her curtains. Louka is the only one who sees through the deception, but she only smirks and leaves in silence. Once safe, the soldier comes out from hiding and explains he is a Swiss mercenary for the Serbian army. He admits to Raina that he does not carry cartridges for his gun, only chocolates, as these are more practical for a starving soldier. Thinking him childish, Raina offers the soldier some chocolate creams, which he devours hungrily. He explains that the cavalry charge led by Raina's fiance Sergius was only successful as a result of dumb luck. Angered, Raina finally demands he leave, yet the Swiss mercenary claims to be too exhausted to move. Feeling pity, Raina agrees to shelter him and runs to find her mother. When the two women return, the chocolate cream soldier, as Raina calls him, has fallen asleep in her bed. The second act begins with Nicola, an older servant, lecturing his fiancee Louka on appropriate conduct toward their employers. As they speak, Major Petkoff, Raina's father, returns from the front. He announces that the war has ended with a peace treaty, upsetting his wife Catherine who believes Bulgaria should have annexed Serbia. Shortly afterward, Raina's fiance Sergius arrives. The once idealistic man has grown cynical, resigning from the military and complaining about the lack of honor and bravery among professional soldiers. He recounts an anecdote about a fleeing Swiss mercenary escaping into the bedroom of a fascinated Bulgarian woman, alarming Raina and Catherine. Once alone, Raina and Sergius speak of their love for each other in reverential and somewhat ridiculous tones. As soon as Raina leaves to get her hat, Sergius embraces Louka and complains about how exhausting his relationship with his fiancee is. Louka claims not to understand the hypocrisy of the upper class, saying that both Sergius and Raina pretend to love each other while flirting with other people. Demanding to know whom Raina has been seeing, Sergius grabs Louka and bruises her arm. Louka asks that he kiss it in apology but Sergius refuses just as Raina enters the garden. As the couple prepares to leave for a walk, Catherine calls Sergius to the library to help Major Petkoff arrange some troop movements. Catherine and Raina discuss the significance of Sergius telling the anecdote about the escaping mercenary. To her mother's chagrin, Raina expresses a desire for Sergius to learn of her part in the story, wishing to shock his faux propriety. As Raina exits, Louka enters and announces that a Swiss officer is at the door. Captain Bluntschli, the chocolate cream soldier, has come to return the coat that was used to smuggle him out of the house. As Catherine attempts to send him away, Major Petkoff recognizes him from the peace negotiations, greets him warmly, and asks him to help coordinate Bulgarian troop movements. Raina sees him in the hallway and gasps that it is the chocolate cream soldier. Thinking quickly, she explains to her father and fiancee that she made a chocolate cream decoration in the shape of a soldier, but that Nicola has clumsily crushed it. Later that afternoon, Captain Bluntschli makes short work of the administrative tasks. Major Petkoff wonders about the fate of his old lost coat. At Catherine's request, Nicola fetches the coat that had previously disappeared, astounding the Major. The Major, Sergius and Catherine leave to implement Bluntschli's orders, leaving the Captain alone with Raina. Raina begins posturing, complaining how morally wounded she is by having to lie for him. The Captain sees through her act and confronts her; he is the first person to see her pretentious behavior for what it is. Raina admits to behaving theatrically and suspects Bluntschli must despise her. On the contrary, Bluntschli is charmed by her posturing but cannot take it seriously. Suddenly, Bluntschli receives a telegram informing him of his father's death and his large inheritance. Raina and Bluntschli exit as Louka and then Sergius enter. Sergius inspects Louka's arm and offers to kiss her bruise but is rejected. Louka questions his notions of bravery, arguing that anyone may be brave in battle but few are able to stand up to social expectations. She asks Sergius if he would marry someone below his station for love. Sergius claims he would but uses his engagement to Raina as an excuse. Hurt, Louka teases him with the knowledge that Bluntschli is Raina's true love. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel. Raina enters and argues with Sergius, announcing that she saw him embracing Louka. Bluntschli explains to Sergius that Raina only let him remain in her room at gunpoint. Somewhat deflated, Sergius withdraws from the duel. When Bluntschli suggests that Louka join the conversation, Sergius leaves to look for her, only to find her eavesdropping in the hallway. Having understood that something is awry, Major Petkoff enters and demands to know who the chocolate cream soldier is. Bluntschli admits that it is he. Raina explains that she is no longer engaged to Sergius, as he loves Louka. Sergius kisses Louka's hand, committing himself to marry her. Louka's original fiance Nicola gracefully bows out. Bluntschli follows Sergius' lead and asks for Raina's hand. The Captain's new inheritance - a successful chain of hotels - persuades Major Petkoff to agree to the marriage. Bluntschli leaves to take care of his father's estate with promises to return in a fortnight."
The Aeneid,"Virgil's seminal epic, the Aeneid, tells the story of Aeneas's journey in search of the land where he is destined to build the city that will one day become the great Roman Empire. Largely influenced by Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, the Aeneid begins halfway through Aeneas's journey, as he nears the city of Carthage, ruled over by Dido, who built the city after fleeing from her murderous brother. Over dinner one night, he tells Dido and her court about his travels thus far. Aeneas recounts the story of the fall of Troy, and how he was forced to leave the city of his birth with his father Anchises, his son Ascanius, and his wife Creusa. During the flight, he lost Creusa, whose shade appeared to him, telling him to follow his destiny, which is to build a great city and take a royal bride. Aeneas and the other Trojan refugees set out to sea, where they had a great many adventures before arriving in Carthage: believing that their destined land was in Crete, they founded a city there, only to be struck down by a plague that forced them to leave; they fought against the Harpies and were cursed by their leader, Celeano; they fled the island of the Cyclops to avoid being slaughtered by the one-eyed beasts; Anchises died on the island of Drepanum. When Aeneas finishes telling Dido his tale, she realizes that she has become inflamed with love for him, and she pursues him relentlessly. Juno manipulates the situation so that the pair spends the night in a cave, where they become lovers. Eventually, however, Aeneas realizes that he has been abandoning his destiny by dallying in Carthage, so he readies his men to leave. Dido has convinced herself that the two are in fact husband and wife, and she is so distraught by her lover's abandonment that she builds a funeral pyre and slays herself on it using Aeneas's sword. As Aeneas and his men sail away from Carthage, they see the city aflame, the residents in a panic, but they do not know that the queen has died. The fleet sails to Drepanum, where they engage in celebrations commemorating the one-year anniversary of Anchises's death, and Aeneas receives a prophecy telling him to travel to the Underworld to meet with his father. With the sibyl of Cumae, Deiphobe, as his guide, Aeneas travels through the Underworld in search of Anchises. On the journey, Aeneas sees a great many terrible sights, including restless souls who have not received proper burials, the ghosts of dead babies, and the terrifying fortress Tartarus, where the most horrible sinners live in eternal torture. When he finally locates his father in the beautiful Elysium, where only the most heroic souls go to rest, Anchises shows him the shades that, once reincarnated, will become the heroes of the Roman Empire. Aeneas returns to the land of the living, certain of the need to fulfill his destiny, and then sets sail for Laurentum, where he will build his great city. When Aeneas and his men arrive in Laurentum, they are greeted warmly by King Latinus, who has heard a prophecy that his daughter, Lavinia, should be wed to a foreigner. Juno, however, angered by the treaty, sends one of the Furies to stir up trouble. The Fury Allecto starts a war between the Trojans and the Latins by striking anger into the heart of Turnus, Lavinia's other suitor. She also inspires Latinus's wife, Queen Amata, to do all that she can to prevent the Trojans from building their city in Laurentum. Turnus calls the Latin men to arms against the foreigners, and a terrible, drawn-out battle ensues. Aeneas seeks the aid of King Evander, ruler of a poor neighboring kingdom, and the Etruscans, who wish to avenge the wrong done to them by Mezentius, one of Turnus's supporters. King Evander entrusts his son, Pallas, to fight at the great warrior's side, but Pallas is brutally slain by Turnus - a move that Turnus will come to regret. Eventually, even the Latins come to realize the inevitability of the Trojan victory, and they call for a one-on-one duel between Turnus and Aeneas. Just as the duel is about to begin, however, Turnus's sister Juturna inflames the Latin troops. A young Trojan is killed, and the battle begins once again. Finally, even Turnus realizes that the only way to end the slaughter is through a duel, so the two meet in a field. Aeneas clearly has the upper hand throughout the battle, even though Turnus is aided by his sister, Juturna, until Jupiter intervenes and declares that the gods may no longer meddle in mortal affairs. Finally, Aeneas strikes Turnus to the ground, and the fallen man pleads for his life, or at least for his corpse to be sent back to his father for burial. Although Aeneas is momentarily moved by his adversary's plea, he sees that Turnus has callously slung Pallas's belt across his shoulders, and Aeneas decides not to be merciful. The epic ends with Aeneas plunging his sword through Turnus's heart and then with Turnus's moaning shade fleeing to the Underworld."
Ghosts,"The action takes place in modern Norway in the estate on the west coast of the country. There is a little rain. Thundering with wooden soles, a carpenter Engstrand enters the houses. The maid Regina tells him to be quiet: upstairs is sleeping just arrived from Paris, Oswald - the son of Alving. Carpenter says: shelter, which he had built, is ready for the tomorrow opening. Engstrand earned a decent sum of money on the construction and she is going to open in the city's his own establishment - a hotel for sailors. The carpenter leaves. In the living room appears Pastor Manders, he dissuades Alving of insurance of the built shelter - here is no need to question the firmness of the godly case. By the way, why Alving does not want Regina to move to her father in town? Oswald joins his mother and pastor. He argues with Manders, rebuking the moral image of the bohemian. Morality in artists and performers environment is no better and no worse than in any other class. Alving supports her son, the Pastor needlessly condemns her for reading freethinking books - with his clearly unconvincing protection of the dogmas of the church he only excites interest for them. Oswald goes for a walk. Pastor is annoyed. Has life taught Alving nothing? Does she remember how just a year after the wedding, she was running away from her husband to the Manders house and refused to return? Then the pastor managed to return her home, to the path of duty, to the home and the legitimate spouse. Has not Chamberlain Alving behaved like a real man? He multiplied the family fortune and fruitful work for the benefit of society. And did not he make her, his wife, his business assistant? Current Oswald's perverse views is a direct consequence of his lack of home education - Alfing insisted that the son was studying away from home. Pastor's words wounded Alving. Pastor knows that she did not love her late husband: Chamberlain Alving had bought her in her relatives. Handsome and charming, he has not stopped drinking and leading dissolute life after the wedding. No wonder she ran away from him. She loved Manders, and, apparently, he liked her too. And Manders is mistaken if he thinks that Alving has changed - he died profligate as he always has been. Moreover, he made a flaw in his own house: she found him one day on the balcony with the maid Johanna. Does Manders know that their maid Regina is an illegitimate daughter of Chamberlain? For a considerable sum carpenter Engstrand agreed to cover the sin of Johanna, and he does not know the whole truth about it - for him Johanna came up with a visiting American. As for her son, she has forcibly sent him out of the house. When he was seven years old, he began to ask too many questions. After the incident with the maid Fru Alving took holds of the house into her own hands. And she's been making tremendous efforts hiding from the public behavior of her husband. After finishing the confession Alving escorted the pastor to the door. And they both heard, passing by the dining room, a cry of Regina escaping from the Oswald's embrace. It seems to her that she is transported back in time and sees the couple on the balcony - chamberlain and maid Johanna. It became known that Oswald is ill. According to the diagnosis of a Parisian doctor, the disease is inherited, but Oswald, who almost did not know his father and always idealized him, did not believe the doctor, he believes the cause of the disease is his frivolous adventures in Paris at the beginning of studies. In addition, he is tortured by a constant inexplicable fear. He and his mother are sitting in the living room, and Fru Alving, wants to remove the son's feeling of guilt telling him the truth about his father and Regina, whom he promised already a trip to Paris. Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by the appearance of the pastor and Regina's shouting. There is a fire not far from the house! ""Shelter named after Chamberlain Alving"" is burning. The time is coming to the morning. The same living room. On the table the lamp is still burning. Artful carpenter Engstrand blackmail Manders, claiming that it was he, the pastor, who awkwardly removing carbon deposits from the spark created a fire hazard. However, he should not worry, Engstrand will not tell anything about it. But let the pastor help him in good undertakings - equipment in city hotels for sailors. Pastor agrees. Carpenter and pastor leave, they are replaced in the living room by Fru Alving and Oswald, who had just returned from a fire that could not be put off. The interrupted conversation is resumed. Within this night Oswald's mother had time to think about many things. Now, telling the son the truth about his father, she is not as strict of the husband's deeds - his gifted and strong nature has not simply found a use in the wilderness and they were wasted on sensual pleasures. Oswald understood what it was. Let him know that present in their conversation Regina is his sister. Hearing this, Regina quickly says goodbye and leaves them. She was about to leave, when she learned that Oswald was ill. Only now Oswald tells his mother why he had previously asked her if she was ready to do anything for him. And why he, among other things, needed Regina so much. It has not fully told his mother about the illness - he is doomed to madness, a second seizure would turn it into a mindless animal. Regina could easily have given him to drink prepared in the bottle morphine. Now he gives the bottle his mother. Mother is comforting Oswald. His seizure has passed, he is at home, he will recover. It is nice here. Yesterday, the whole day rain was drizzling, but today he sees his homeland in all its present splendor, Fru Alving goes to the window and extinguishes the lamp. Let Oswald look at the rising sun and sparkling beneath mountain glaciers! Oswald looks out the window, silently repeating ""the sun, the sun,"" but does not see the sun. Mother looks at her son, clutching a vial of morphine."
Hedda Gabler,"Meet Hedda Tesman. She's kicking around in Norway in the 1890s, so she's very repressed, both socially and sexually. She's the daughter of the now-deceased General Gabler, which means she grew up rich and privileged. Now she's married to George Tesman, a would-be professor and a bit of an academic bore. Hedda has just returned from her six-month honeymoon with George and is settling into married life in the house he has bought specifically to please her, though it meant stretching beyond his means financially. On top of the boredom and repression, Hedda is in all likelihood pregnant, though she won't admit it despite several hints from George's Aunt Julie, a kind older woman who takes care of her invalid sister Rina.Conflict enters the scene when Mrs. Elvsted visits to the Tesmans on a trip to the city from her country home. She's there looking out for a guy named Eilert Lovborg, a recovering alcoholic who tutors her children. Hedda, the master of manipulation, soon gets Mrs. Elvsted alone and coerces her into admitting the truth: she and Eilert are somehow involved, and she wants to leave her husband for him. Eilert has just published a book - he's in the same field of history as Mr. Tesman - and Mrs. Elvsted has followed him to the city to make sure he doesn't fall back on his old drinking ways. She begs the Tesmans to look out for him, since George is his colleague and friend.Shortly after, Judge Brack, the big man around town, comes by and flirts with Hedda. It's clear he's interested in her. Everyone keeps asking Hedda the same question: why has she, the best catch in town, married a bore like George? Hedda admits that 1) she had to marry someone and 2) she thought George, through his scholarly pursuits, would be famous some day.Eilert eventually stops by the Tesmans and we discover that Hedda has a history with him; they used to be intellectual buddies the way that Eilert now is with Mrs. Elvsted. When Hedda broke off their friendship/budding romance, she did so to avoid the scandal of hanging out with a questionable, renegade alcoholic like Eilert. She also threatened to shoot him with one of her father's pistols. Now that he's with Mrs. Elvsted, Hedda decides to entertain herself by causing some trouble. She tells Eilert that Mrs. Elvsted was afraid he would drink again - in other words, she doesn't trust him. This angers Eilert, who promptly starts drinking again. He goes out to a party with the Judge and Hedda's husband George, but not before revealing a tantalizing and plot-thickening tidbit: he's written another book, this one using information from the past to predict the future. He's written it with the help of his new muse, Mrs. Elvsted. He has the only copy, a hand-written manuscript, with him now and will read some aloud tonight.Mrs. Elvsted stays with Hedda, worried sick that Eilert will drink himself silly at the party. Of course, Eilert drinks himself silly at the party. He never returns that night. While Mrs. Elvsted is sleeping, George comes back early the next morning, tells Hedda about the drunken debauchery, and shows her something: Eilert's manuscript. It seems that Eilert dropped it while drunk and George recovered it, eager to keep it safe so he could return it to his friend once sober. When a letter comes regarding Aunt Rina's fading health, George rushes out, leaving behind the manuscript.Later that morning, Eilert comes running in. Mrs. Elvsted wakes up in time for him to break up with her, telling her that he tore up the manuscript and doesn't want to see her any more. Mrs. Elvsted declares that he has destroyed their child and leaves. Only then does Eilert admit, to Hedda, that he lost the manuscript. Hedda, being Hedda, says nothing about the recovered manuscript and instead gives him a pistol with which to shoot himself. She's eager for Eilert to have a beautiful, poetic death - she wants him to shoot himself in the temple.Finally alone again, Hedda burns the manuscript to ashes. When she confesses this to George later, he is overjoyed that his wife loves him enough to destroy the work of his professional rival. Mrs. Elvsted visits again the next morning to find out what's going on with Eilert, and Judge Brack comes by to tell everyone that Eilert is dead by suicide. Mrs. Elvsted and George, feeling quite horrible, decide to re-write the manuscript using Mrs. Elvsted's notes. While they start work, the Judge takes Hedda aside and tells her that Eilert didn't commit suicide - rather he accidentally shot himself in the gut. Hedda is devastated that the great poetic death she imagined never came to pass. Brack also reveals that the pistol firing the fatal shot was Hedda's -he recognizes it. He can keep this info quiet, but only if she does what he wants.No one tells Hedda what to do. She shoots herself in the temple."
The Merry Wives of Windsor,"Read the full text of The Merry Wives of Windsor with a side-by-side translation HERE. Sir John Falstaff has rolled into the town of Windsor, England, with his posse of ""cony-catching rascals"" and he's at it again. When we catch up with Falstaff in this play, he's completely broke, which has put quite a damper on his rock-star lifestyle. But Falstaff's got a plan. He'll put the moves on a couple of rich housewives named Mistress Ford and Mistress Page . The housewives have total access to their husbands' money so Falstaff thinks he can solve all his financial troubles by luring them into bed with a couple of super-steamy love notes. Since Falstaff's such a busy guy, the love notes are identical except that one says ""Dear Mistress Page"" and the other says ""Dear Mistress Ford."" There's just one hitch. Mistress Page and Mistress Ford are BFFs, which means they tell each other EVERYTHING. When they find out that Falstaff has sent them identical letters, they're seriously offended that Falstaff just assumes they'll cheat on their husbands and Falstaff has sent them the same, ridiculous letter. Our ""merry wives"" hatch a plot to teach Falstaff a lesson he won't forget. They pretend to like him and invite him over for a secret rendezvous with Mistress Ford while her husband is away. To complicate matters, Falstaff's frenemies, Pistol and Nim, have decided to rat out Falstaff to the women's husbands. Master Page trusts his wife and couldn't care less about Falstaff but, Master Ford is crazy jealous. Ford assumes his wife will get down and dirty with Falstaff since all women are liars and cheats, so he disguises himself as a guy named ""Brooke"" and becomes Falstaff's newest drinking buddy. When ""Brooke"" offers Falstaff a boatload of money to help him seduce Mistress Ford, Falstaff takes it and tells ""Brooke"" that, actually, he's going to hook up with Mistress Ford when her husband's away from home. Meanwhile, over in the B-plot, the Pages' teenage daughter Anne has three guys falling all over themselves to marry her because she's rich, still a virgin, and smokin' hot. Back to the main plot. Soon enough, Falstaff shows up at Mistress Ford's house looking to score. When Master Ford comes home, the wives stash the ""fat"" knight in a basket of stinky laundry that hasn't been washed in months and then dump it--and him--into the Thames River. Punk'd! It's so much fun that our merry wives lure Falstaff back to the Ford house a second time. When Master Ford shows up , the wives disguise Falstaff as a local ""witch"" named ""the old woman of Brentford."" Master Ford goes nuts and beats ""her"" black and blue. The women think this is absolutely hilarious and let their husbands in on their little joke, which makes Master Ford all apologetic. Now the couples get together to hatch a new plot. The plan is to get Falstaff to wear a silly costume and have him meet them at the old haunted oak tree. Then, a bunch of townspeople and local kids dressed up as creepy little fairies will jump out of the bushes and terrorize him. Got all that? Okay, good. This is where Shakespeare ties in his subplot to the main action of the play. Master Page tells Slender to elope with Anne on the same night, and tell him that's he'll be the ""fairy"" dressed in white. Mistress Page tells Caius the same thing, except that Anne will be the ""fairy"" dressed in green. Way to pimp out your daughter, guys. Everything seems to be going as planned. Falstaff is terrified, and Caius and Slender each run off with green and white fairies. Falstaff tries to run away from the fairies but, before he can get away, Ashton Kutcher runs out and shoves a video camera in Falstaff's face. Just kidding. The Fords and the Pages run out and confront him. Falstaff knows he's been had so he admits that he's been made into an ""ass"" and all is forgiven. Just as we're wondering what happened to Caius and Slender, they both show up with two boys in green and white fairy costumes, griping about almost getting accidentally hitched to a couple of kids. Then Anne and Fenton show up and are all ""Fooled you! We're married and there's nothing you can do about it."" The Pages have a good-natured laugh about the whole thing and invite everyone back to their house for a wedding feast. The End."
The Spanish Tragedy,"In the introduction to the play, the Ghost of the Spanish courtier Don Andrea explains its history. After Andrea was slain in a battle against Portugal, his Ghost made its way through the underworld, only to find itself sent back to earth. The character Revenge, his guide, tells him that he has been sent back to witness his former lover Bellimperia kill Balthazar, the ""author of death."" The Ghost and Revenge sit down to watch the spectacle unfold. In the opening act, the Spanish forces return from their victory over Portugal. The General gives an account of the battle to the King, explaining that they have reached a state of ""peace conditional"" and that they have captured the Portuguese prince Balthazar. The Duke of Castile's son Lorenzo and the Marshall Hieronimo's son Horatio, however, dispute their respective roles in capturing the Portuguese prince. The King rewards them both. Meanwhile, in Portugal, the Viceroy laments his son's death. The loyal Alexandro tells him that his son is in fact still alive. Another nobleman, Villuppo, however, declares that he saw Alexandro shoot Balthazar in the back. Alexandro is immediately imprisoned. In Spain, Horatio recounts the battle to Bellimperia, Lorenzo's sister and Andrea's former lover. The two begin to fall in love. In the same scene, Balthazar also expresses his love for Bellimperia. The Portuguese ambassador arrives, and Hieronimo stages a masque for him and the King. The act closes with Revenge foreboding a general demise. In the second act, the King of Spain attempts to arrange a marriage between Bellimperia and Balthazar. Bellimperia, however, is in love with Horatio. As the two make their way to a secluded bower, the servant Pedringano betrays them to Lorenzo and Balthazar. Horatio is hung from an arbor and stabbed to death. Hieronimo enters to find his son's body and vows revenge. The Ghost expresses dismay at the turn of events, but Revenge advises him to be patient. The Viceroy discovers the truth about his son in the third act. He immediately sets Alexandro free and condemns Villuppo to a painful death. In Spain, Bellimperia is held captive, but manages to send Hieronimo a letter in which she reveals the identity of Horatio's killers. Lorenzo, on the other hand, attempts to purge all evidence of the murder. He makes Pedringano shoot Serberine , and then plots successfully to have Pedringano himself hanged. Pedringano's last letter to Lorenzo, however, falls into Hieronimo's hands. Hieronimo thus confirms Bellimperia's accusations and resolves to demand justice before the King. At home, his wife Isabelle ""runs lunatic."" Like his wife, Hieronimo shows distinct signs of madness. He contemplates suicide, but again vows to first exact revenge for Horatio's death. The Portuguese ambassador, meanwhile, arrives with good news: the Viceroy has consented to the marriage between Balthazar and Bellimperia . Hieronimo calls for justice before the King, but undermines himself by falling into a frenzy. Later, several citizens come to petition Hieronimo, but once again Hieronimo is carried away in an ecstatic fit. The Viceroy himself arrives at the end of the act. While the nuptial celebrations are prepared, the Duke confronts Lorenzo and Hieronimo about the negative rumors surrounding the two. Hieronimo denies any wrongdoing on Lorenzo's part, and Bellimperia seems to have reconciled with Balthazar. The Ghost is alarmed at such an unexpected turn of events, but Revenge once again reassures him that all is well . In the final act, Bellimperia and Hieronimo work together to exact their revenge on Lorenzo and Balthazar. Hieronimo wrote a tragedy in his youth, which the two young men now act out for the royal audience. Back in the arbor where Horatio was murdered, Isabella commits suicide. As for Hieronimo's play, the plot is executed smoothly, and Lorenzo and Balthazar are killed on stage. Bellimperia, too, commits suicide. The King, the Viceroy, and the Duke are all horrified when they discover that the play seemed to merely be a simulation. They demand to know Hieronimo's motives, but the latter bites off his tongue, stabs the Duke, and finally commits suicide."
Daisy Miller,"Attention: spoilers all over the place below. Read the story first. Seriously. Boy meets girl, girl plays hard-to-get, girl dies, boy goes back to older lover in Geneva. Frederick Winterbourne is bored by his life. He mostly hangs out with older ladies: visiting his elderly aunt in her European homes and engaging in some kind of affair with an older woman in Geneva. In Vevay, Switzerland, he meets the vivacious young Daisy Miller, a girl from Schenectady, NY traveling through Europe with her clueless mother and badly behaved little brother, and his world is turned upside down. He likes Daisy, but her erratic, flirtatious behavior confuses and irritates him. The following winter, he meets up with Daisy in Rome only to find she's been flirting like crazy with all of the Italian dudes. She starts hanging out a little too intimately and a little too publicly with an Italian social climber named Mr. Giovanelli. People start to talk, and Winterbourne is torn: is Daisy tacky and ridiculous or hot and fun? And is she engaged to Giovanelli or not? He can't get a straight answer. Winterbourne tries to get Daisy to tone it down and she makes fun of him for being boring. He almost loses it when he sees her out alone at night with Giovanelli at the Colosseum, a location where people typically contract Roman fever . A few weeks later, she's sick as a dog. Yep, she's got malaria. When she dies, her mother passes on a message to Winterbourne: Daisy wanted him to know she was never engaged to Giovanelli. After thinking this through, he decides he should have made a move when he had a chance instead of nagging her like a nerdy older brother. At the end, he concludes he's ""lived too long in foreign parts"" . Poor thing."
Tartuffe,"The entire play is set in Orgon's house. The play opens when Madame Pernelle decides to leave her son Orgon's house because she finds their behavior immoral and decadent. She sees her grandson Damis as a brat, and her granddaughter Mariane as too fragile. It is only the new houseguest, Tartuffe, who earns her approbation. Tartuffe has been invited to stay by the house's master Orgon, who is infatuated by Tartuffe's seeming piety. The rest of the family believes Tartuffe to be a fraud and a liar, but cannot convince Madame Pernelle to see him this way. After Madame Pernelle departs, the servant Dorine and Orgon's brother-in-law Cleante discuss how they might convince Orgon that Tartuffe is manipulating him. Damis is concerned that, under Tartuffe's influence, Orgon might refuse to let Mariane marry her beloved Valere even though he has already promised to approve the match. When Orgon arrives, Cleante begs him to see through Tartuffe's act, but Orgon waxes poetic about how he observed Tartuffe's pious poverty and humility first-hand. Cleante suggests that Tartuffe's flamboyant displays of piety suggest hypocrisy, but Orgon is unmoved. Cleante is particularly concerned when Orgon dodges his questions about Mariane's impending marriage. In Act II, Orgon announces that he intends Mariane to marry Tartuffe. She is surprised, but shows the obedience she believes is expected of her. Dorine brassily pleads with Orgon to change his intent, suggesting the age difference between Mariane and Tartuffe will lead the lady to infidelity. Orgon is annoyed at her boldness, and tries to send her away. Once Orgon leaves, Dorine reminds the overly-obedient Mariane about her love for Valere, but the young woman feels compelled to honor her father's wishes. When Valere enters, having heard the rumor about Orgon's plans, both he and Mariane argue in a juvenile fashion, but Dorine calms them down. All three agree to work together to counteract Orgon and Tartuffe's plans. In Act III, Dorine advises Damis to quell his hotheadedness so that he does not ruin their plan. She intends to let Elmire control Tartuffe, since it is clear that he lusts after her. Tartuffe appears for the first time, and Dorine leaves him with Elmire. She begs him to renounce all claims to Mariane, but he dodges the request and propositions her. Shocked, she denies him but threatens to tell Orgon about his lechery unless he approves the marriage between Valere and Mariane. He seems ready to agree, when Damis angrily reveals himself, having overheard Tartuffe's illicit demands. His anger attracts Orgon to the room, at which point Damis reveals the truth about Tartuffe despite Elmire's requests for him to stay quiet. Tartuffe enacts a false show of piety, which impresses Orgon. When Damis refuses to withdraw his claim, Orgon banishes him from the house. When Tartuffe feigns humility and asks to leave, Orgon insists Tartuffe spend all his time around Elmire, and names Tartuffe his heir. In Act IV, Cleante tries to crack Tartuffe's facade, to no avail. Mariane implores her father to let her marry Valere, but he refuses. Elmire finally convinces Orgon to hide and eavesdrop on a conversation in which she will reveal Tartuffe for whom he truly is. He agrees. Elmire leads Tartuffe into a room alone, and claims she feels lust for him as well. He is initially suspicious, and demands she give him physical proof of her affection. When Orgon does not reveal himself, she agrees to sleep with Tartuffe but first asks him to verify that Orgon is not hiding in the hallway. While Tartuffe is momentarily gone, Orgon emerges and admits he has been fooled. When Tartuffe returns, Orgon banishes him from the house, but Tartuffe reveals that he has both the deed to the house and a strongbox that can cause trouble for Orgon. In Act V, Orgon explains to Cleante that the strongbox could cause great political trouble for him since it contains the papers of a friend who has been disloyal to the King. Orgon is furious over Tartuffe's false piety, but Cleante convinces him that not all holy men are impostors. Damis and Madame Pernelle return, and the family tries to convince the older woman to accept the truth of Tartuffe's treachery. A bailiff named Monsieur Loyal cons his way inside to deliver a legal document that requires the family to vacate the house, which Tartuffe now owns. Everyone is doubly horrified when Valere arrives with worse news: Tartuffe has brought the strongbox to the King, who has sworn out a warrant for Orgon's arrest. Right before Orgon flees, the Exempt, a police officer of the King, arrives with Tartuffe. Tartuffe scoffs at Orgon's plight, and revels in his victory. This victory is short-lived, however, for the Exempt suddenly arrests Tartuffe, explaining that the King saw through the hypocrite's deceit. The family rejoices, and Orgon announces that he will begin planning Mariane and Valere's wedding."
A Christmas Carol,"Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly, cold-hearted creditor, continues his stingy, greedy ways on Christmas Eve. He rejects a Christmas dinner invitation, and all the good tidings of the holiday, from his jolly nephew, Fred; he yells at charity workers; and he overworks his employee, Bob Cratchit. At night, Scrooge's former partner Jacob Marley, dead for seven years, visits him in the form of a ghost. Marley's spirit has been wandering since he died as punishment for being consumed with business and not with people while alive. He has come to warn Scrooge and perhaps save him from the same fate. He tells him Three Spirits will come to him over the next three nights. Scrooge falls asleep and wakes up to find the Ghost of Christmas Past, a small, elderly figure. The Ghost shows Scrooge scenes from the past that trace Scrooge's development from a young boy, lonely but with the potential for happiness, to a young man with the first traces of greed that would deny love in his life. Scrooge shows newfound emotion when revisiting these scenes, often crying from identification with his former neglected self. Scrooge goes to sleep and is awakened by the Ghost of Christmas Present, a giant with a life span of one day. He shows Scrooge several current scenes of Christmas joy and charity, then shows him the Cratchit household. The Ghost informs Scrooge that unless the future is changed, the Cratchit's crippled and good-hearted young son, Tiny Tim, will die. He also shows Scrooge the party at Fred's house. Finally, a ragged boy and girl crawl out from the Ghost's robes. The Ghost calls them Ignorance and Want and warns Scrooge to beware of Ignorance. The silent, black-clad Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come replaces the other ghost. He shows Scrooge several scenes of people discussing someone's death; no one seems pained by the death, and most are happy about it. Scrooge does not know, however, who the man is. He learns that Tiny Tim has died, but the Cratchits maintain their unity and love. Scrooge finally discovers that he is the one who has died and whose death has only pleased people. He expresses the hope that these scenes of the future can be changed, and vows to incorporate the lessons of the past, present, and future into his adoption of the Christmas spirit. Scrooge wakes up in his bedroom and learns that the whole adventure took only one night, not threeit is Christmas Day. In addition to smiling and being friendly to everyone he sees, he sends a large turkey to the Cratchits, gives a sizable donation to the charity worker he previously insulted, and has a wonderful time at Fred's party. The next day he gives Cratchit a raise. Scrooge continues his kindly ways after Christmas, befriending everyone and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die. He never sees the ghosts again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart as well as anyone."
An Enemy of the People,"The play is set in a small town in Norway, which has recently become famous for the Kirsten Springs. The Springs were built by the town and lure visitors with their promise of health and vitality. At the opening of the play, Catherine Stockmann entertains various guests in her home. Her brother-in-law, the town's mayor and chairman of the board for the Springs, stops by and waxes poetic about how the Springs are revitalizing their town. Not long after he leaves, Stockmann himself comes home. His daughter, Petra, a young woman in her twenties who is a schoolteacher, hands him a letter that came in the mail. Stockmann reads it in private and returns to his family, exultant. He explains that he had long found it suspicious that so many people were getting sick lately, and secretly ordered tests of the Springs' water. The letter included the results of the tests, demonstrating that microscopic bacteria from the tannery above the Springs were polluting the water. His family is happy for him, and he is confident that, when he tells his brother about it, the town will move to renovate the Springs. Hovstad, the editor of the People's Daily Messenger, who is there visiting the family, is ardently supportive and tells him he will run the article in his paper. The next day, Catherine's father, Morten Kiil, stops by. He tells Stockmann he heard about the report but thinks it is a hilarious joke Stockmann wants to play on his brother. Then Hovstad and Aslaksen, the newspaper's publisher and Chairman of the Property Owners' Association, arrive. Hovstad is on fire about routing the town's entrenched authority, and Aslaksen cautions moderation but says the people are behind Stockmann. After the newspapermen leave, Peter comes by to talk to his brother. He tells him sternly that he is angry that Stockmann went behind his back, and that the proposed plan will bankrupt the town. Stockman is aghast at his brother's behavior and says that Peter is only upset because he does not want to be held responsible for it, as his administration approved the Springs. Peter replies that a government needs moral authority, and he forbids Stockmann to tell the public. Stockman says it is already getting out and he will use the press. Furious, Peter demands that he keep his convictions to himself and stop trying to ruin the town. Catherine and Petra enter as the brothers' argument heats up. After Peter leaves, Catherine wonders about Stockmann's duty to his family vs. his duty to uphold the truth. The next day Hovstad, Aslaksen, and Billing, a journalist, meet in the newspaper's office. They are excited to print Stockmann's piece. Petra visits and tells Hovstad that she does not believe the newspaper has principles because it wants to print a translated novel about good people being rewarded and bad people being punished. She leaves after Hovstad tries to ingratiate himself with her but accidentally criticizes her father. Peter visits the office and manages to sow doubt and persuade the men not to run the report, as it results in a high tax that will hurt the town. Peter hides when he hears Stockmann coming. Stockmann enters the office and begins to wonder why the men are hesitant about the article. He sees Peter's cane on a table and realizes what happened. Catherine and Petra enter the office and Catherine condemns Hovstad for doing her husband ill. Peter comes out of hiding and he and Stockmann argue once more. Stockman claims he will march through the street if he has to, now that the newspaper will not print his article. In Act II, Stockmann meets with Captain Horster, a traveling sea captain, at the captain's house. Horster has agreed to hold a lecture by Stockmann. People begin to trickle in and take their seats. A drunk man behaves obnoxiously. The townspeople seem antipathetic towards Stockmann, especially when he takes the stage. It is suggested to have a moderator, and Aslaksen is selected. Peter get to speaks first, criticizing his brother as wanting to destroy the town, and painting him as the enemy. He says that his right to free speech is curtailed in a time of danger. He also tells the story of the town before the Springs came, and how in the future everyone would be rich. Finally, he asks that Stockmann not be allowed to read his report. Stockman is frustrated but stands and promises he will not talk about the Springs. The heckling ceases for a bit and he begins. He condemns the people's ignorance and the tyranny of the majority. He begs people to think of the risk of getting of sick. The crowd is furious and hostile, and cares for nothing Stockmann says. He is called an enemy of the people, and people shout him out of the room. Captain Horster says the family can go on his ship to America with him. In Act III, the family experiences the animus of the town. Rocks are thrown into their windows, they are evicted from their home, and Petra is fired. They plan to go to America but Catherine is nervous that things will not change. Peter comes over and tries to get Stockmann to agree to a statement that he was wrong, but Stockmann holds fast. Peter accuses his brother of a plot, as it seems Morten Kiil is buying up stock in the Springs. Stockmann has no idea what is going on, but Peter assumes he does. Later Kiil arrives and confirms this, because he was responsible for the tannery that polluted the Springs in the first place. He wants Stockmann to clear his name. Stockmann is irate and refuses, and the men part with ill words. Horster visits the house and tells them he cannot take them on his ship because the owner got rid of him as captain due to his affiliation with Stockmann. The Stockmann boys come home and Morten explains he was beaten up because another boy called his father a traitor and he fought back. This enrages Stockmann. He decides the family will not retreat -they will stay and fight for what is right. They will educate the children at home and Stockmann will embrace his role as enemy of the people. They have truth on their side and will be strong and victorious."
The Seagull,"Konstantin, the son of Arkadina , has written a play. It is to be performed outside, on his uncle Sorin's estate, starring the woman Konstantin is in love with, Nina. Waiting for Konstantin's play to begin, Medvedenko, the local schoolteacher, asks Masha, with whom he is in love, why she always wears black. Masha, in love with Konstantin, is in mourning for her life. Sorin and Konstantin enter, talking about the boredom of the country, and Konstantin expounds upon his longing for ""new forms"" in the theatre. He has had Yakov and the workmen erect him a makeshift theater in the garden, and Konstantin is delighted with it. Sorin and Konstantin talk about Konstantin's mother, Arkadina, and Konstantin opines that his mother and he stand for entirely different theatrical traditions, and tells Sorin that he longs to become a famous writer. Sorin changes the subject and asks about Arkadina's new man, Trigorin, to whom Konstantin seems indifferent. Trigorin is a famous writer. Nina arrives, asks Konstantin about Trigorin. Konstantin professes his love to her, and she doesn't reciprocate directly. Nina tells Konstantin that his play is more like a recitation than a play - it doesn't have living characters or action. All of the characters gather to watch the play, and, after Arkadina and Konstantin quote a few lines from Hamlet, the play begins. Nina sits on a stone, dressed in white, and gives a monologue about an apocalypse in which all of the world's souls are merged into one. Arkadina interrupts the play with comic asides until Konstantin loses his temper, brings the curtain down, and storms off. When Sorin ticks off Arkadina for being insensitive, she too gets angry that Konstantin has tried to give her ""an object-lesson"" in acting and writing. Arkadina leads reminiscing about years gone by, when Dorn, the local doctor, was the romantic ""leading man"" of the lakeside. Masha goes off to find Konstantin, and Dorn has Yakov, a workman, lift the curtain. Trigorin tells Nina, when she appears, that he didn't understand the play, and Nina exits to go home. Dorn, left alone, says that he liked the play, and he tells Konstantin when he re-appears, moving him deeply. Writing has to have clear aims, Dorn says. Masha then appears as Konstantin exits and confesses to Dorn her love for Konstantin as the curtain falls. The curtain of the second act rises on a discussion, led by Arkadina, about whether Arkadina or Masha looks younger. The verdict, Arkadina ensures, is in her own favor. Nina enters with Sorin, as her parents have gone away for a few days, and so she is free to do as she chooses. An argument between Shamrayev, Sorin's estate manager and Masha's father, and Arkadina about carriage horses leads to Arkadina's storming out after announcing that she will immediately leave for the town. Sorin goes off to persuade Arkadina to stay, and Polina, Shamrayev's wife makes romantic advances on Dorn. She is furious when he ignores them. As Dorn and Polina exit, Nina, left alone on stage, muses about the strangeness of famous people - Trigorin and Arkadina. Konstantin enters and presents Nina with a seagull he has shot, which he lays at her feet. She doesn't understand the symbolism of it. Trigorin enters, taking notes for a story about Masha, and a conversation between Nina and Trigorin strikes up about the difficulties of writing and being creative. Trigorin describes writing as a more or less pleasureless obsession: and Trigorin knows he is not in the league of Turgenev or Tolstoy. When he sees Konstantin's seagull, Trigorin has an idea for a story about a man who comes and quite idly destroys a young girl. Then, through a window, Arkadina appears to announce to Trigorin that they are staying. Act 3 begins with Masha telling Trigorin her life story, clearly in the hope that he might one day turn it into fiction. She has taken to drink and resolved to marry Medvedenko, despite the fact that she is still in love with Konstantin. We discover that Konstantin has attempted to shoot himself since Act 2. Nina presents Trigorin with a medallion on which she has had his initials, and the title of his book, engraved. After she has exited, Trigorin reads the medallion and discovers an inscription: ""Days and Nights, page 121, lines 11 and 12"". He quickly exits to find a copy of his book to discover what line Nina refers to. Meanwhile, Arkadina and Sorin have a discussion about Konstantin, and Sorin asks Arkadina to give Konstantin some money. She refuses. After Sorin exits, Konstantin enters and asks Arkadina to give Sorin some money. She refuses. Arkadina then bandages Konstantin's head and they remember Konstantin's childhood together. Their discussion fast becomes an argument which leaves Konstantin in tears. Arkadina promises Konstantin that, as she is taking Trigorin away, Nina will return to him and he will again be happy. Konstantin exits. Trigorin enters. He has discovered, though he does not reveal it to Arkadina, the line Nina referred to - ""If ever you have need to my life, then come and take it"". Trigorin and Arkadina next have a conversation, in which she persuades him to remain with her by flattery alone. Delighted to have persuaded Trigorin, Arkadina's party leaves for the town, though, at the last minute Trigorin comes in to find his stick. Nina meets him, the two arrange to meet at a Moscow hotel, and share a kiss as the curtain falls. Two years have passed by the time Act 4 opens. The scene is set in a room in Sorin's house which has become Konstantin's study. Konstantin has now been published as a writer, and is now quite well known. Medvedenko and Masha are now married, and Medvedenko goes off home to look after their baby. Masha is still, painfully, hanging around Konstantin, and her mother makes up a bed in the room for Sorin who has become ill. We learn that Nina had a baby which died, became a mediocre actress, and is currently back in the town, disowned by her parents. Konstantin is now a published writer, and, as Arkadina and Trigorin enter, Trigorin brings a magazine with an article by Konstantin in it. A card-table is set up in the middle of the room, and, as everyone settles to play lotto, Konstantin exits. While he is out, we hear various opinions of his writing - Shamrayev notes that he gets bad reviews, Trigorin says that he hasn't yet found his own voice, Dorn says he likes his stories, and Arkadina reveals she's never read any of them. Konstantin is left alone in the room as everyone goes off to dinner, and delivers a soliloquy about his longing for new forms. Nina knocks at the window, and enters, and her and Konstantin have a frantic conversation, in which she claims to be ""the seagull"" before she exits. Konstantin tears up his manuscripts and exits. When everyone comes back in, Shamrayev unveils the stuffed seagull which Konstantin shot back in Act 2. A bang is heard off-stage, and Dorn telling everyone that a bottle of ether has burst, exits to investigate. On his re-entrance, he takes Trigorin to one side and tells him to get Arkadina out of the room - Konstantin has shot himself."
Alice in Wonderland,"Alice is sitting with her sister outdoors when she spies a White Rabbit with a pocket watch. Fascinated by the sight, she follows the rabbit down the hole. She falls for a long time, and finds herself in a long hallway full of doors. There is also a key on the table, which unlocks a tiny door; through this door, she spies a beautiful garden. She longs to get there, but the door is too small. Soon, she finds a drink with a note that asks her to drink it. There is later a cake with a note that tells her to eat; Alice uses both, but she cannot seem to get a handle on things, and is always either too large to get through the door or too small to reach the key. While she is tiny, she slips and falls into a pool of water. She realizes that this little sea is made of tears she cried while a giant. She swims to shore with a number of animals, most notably a sensitive mouse, but manages to offend everyone by talking about her cat's ability to catch birds and mice. Left alone, she goes on through the wood and runs into the White Rabbit. He mistakes her for his maid and sends her to fetch some things from his house. While in the White Rabbit's home, she drinks another potion and becomes too huge to get out through the door. She eventually finds a little cake which, when eaten, makes her small again. In the wood again, she comes across a Caterpillar sitting on a mushroom. He gives her some valuable advice, as well as a valuable tool: the two sides of the mushroom, which can make Alice grow larger and smaller as she wishes. The first time she uses them, she stretches her body out tremendously. While stretched out, she pokes her head into the branches of a tree and meets a Pigeon. The Pigeon is convinced that Alice is a serpent, and though Alice tries to reason with her the Pigeon tells her to be off. Alice gets herself down to normal proportions and continues her trek through the woods. In a clearing she comes across a little house and shrinks herself down enough to get inside. It is the house of the Duchess; the Duchess and the Cook are battling fiercely, and they seem unconcerned about the safety of the baby that the Duchess is nursing. Alice takes the baby with her, but the child turns into a pig and trots off into the woods. Alice next meets the Cheshire cat . The Cheshire cat helps her to find her way through the woods, but he warns her that everyone she meets will be mad. Alice goes to the March Hare's house, where she is treated to a Mad Tea Party. Present are the March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse. Ever since Time stopped working for the Hatter, it has always been six o'clock; it is therefore always teatime. The creatures of the Mad Tea Party are some of the must argumentative in all of Wonderland. Alice leaves them and finds a tree with a door in it: when she looks through the door, she spies the door-lined hallway from the beginning of her adventures. This time, she is prepared, and she manages to get to the lovely garden that she saw earlier. She walks on through, and finds herself in the garden of the Queen of Hearts. There, three gardeners are painting the roses red. If the Queen finds out that they planted white roses, she'll have them beheaded. The Queen herself soon arrives, and she does order their execution; Alice helps to hide them in a large flowerpot. The Queen invites Alice to play croquet, which is a very difficult game in Wonderland, as the balls and mallets are live animals. The game is interrupted by the appearance of the Cheshire cat, whom the King of Hearts immediately dislikes. The Queen takes Alice to the Gryphon, who in turn takes Alice to the Mock Turtle. The Gryphon and the Mock Turtle tell Alice bizarre stories about their school under the sea. The Mock Turtles sings a melancholy song about turtle soup, and soon afterward the Gryphon drags Alice off to see the trial of the Knave of Hearts. The Knave of Hearts has been accused of stealing the tarts of the Queen of Hearts, but the evidence against him is very bad. Alice is appalled by the ridiculous proceedings. She also begins to grow larger. She is soon called to the witness stand; by this time she has grown to giant size. She refuses to be intimidated by the bad logic of the court and the bluster of the King and Queen of Hearts. Suddenly, the cards all rise up and attack her, at which point she wakes up. Her adventures in Wonderland have all been a fantastic dream."
Idylls of the King,"In the first Idyll, ""The Coming of Arthur,"" King Leodogran of Cameliard has to decide whether or not to marry off his only daughter, Guinevere, to the newly crowned King Arthur. Arthur has driven the pagans out of Jolly Olde England and re-established the rule of law among the warring smaller kingdoms within it. He now rules with the consent of most of his subjects, but a small group of Northern kings are a wee bit PO'd, and believe that Arthur is decidedly not the former king's legitimate heir. This bothers Leodogran, so he asks for different opinions and hears differing stories regarding Arthur's origins from Arthur's knights and his sister. When he has a dream that seems to confirm Arthur's future success, he decides to go ahead and marry Guinevere to Arthur. At the banquet celebrating their wedding, the lords of Rome show up demanding cool presents, but Arthur sends them away empty-handed, announcing that a new order has arrived. Oh snap. In the second Idyll, ""Gareth and Lynette,"" the youngest son of Lot and Bellicent wants to prove himself at Arthur's court. But his mom is not exactly pumped about it, so she forces him to present himself there as a kitchen-hand in an attempt to deter him. When Arthur learns Gareth's true identity, he promises to keep it a secret and to grant him a quest. That quest is to rescue the lands of the Lady Lyonors from four brothers who are holding her hostage in a tower as fairy tale supervillains are wont to do. Her sister, Lady Lynette, who has traveled to Arthur's court in search of a knight, is terribly insulted when she is given a so-called kitchen hand, so she mercilessly mocks Gareth during their journey. But Gareth's prowess eventually wins her over, and by the time he reveals the fourth knight, Death, to be nothing but a young boy, the two have fallen in love, and everyone swoons accordingly. ""The Marriage of Geraint"" tells how Arthur's knight, Geraint, met his wife Enid by fighting to win her the designation of ""most beautiful damsel"" in the Tournament of the Sparrow Hawk. By winning the tournament, he also avenged an insult to Guinevere and rescued Enid's family and town from oppression by the tyrant Edyrn. Efficient jousting, no? In ""Geraint and Enid,"" Geraint becomes convinced that his wife has been contaminated with Guinevere's ""taint"" and is cheating on him. In what can only be described as a bizarre response, he forces Enid to put on her ugliest dress and ride behind him without speaking to him. Um, okay. Enid proves her devotion by telling Geraint about a former lover's attempt to seduce her, weeping over Geraint's body when she believes him to be dead, and refusing another man's advances. Geraint reconciles with her and even allows her to hang out with the ""tainted"" Queen Guinevere again. Thanks? In ""Balin and Balan,"" the rough-around-the-edges Balin attempts to act all civilized and fancy at court while his brother is away in search of a demon in the lands of King Pellam. He takes Guinevere as his inspiration for this feat. But when he witnesses a meeting between her and Lancelot one day, he flees Camelot in confusion--what has he just seen? In King Pellam's woods, the sorceress Vivien fabricates a story that confirms his suspicion that Lancelot and Guinevere are having an affair. Hearing his howl of pain, his brother Balan mistakes him for the demon and attacks him. The brothers die in one another's arms. Vivien travels to Camelot in an attempt to poison the court with the rumor of Guinevere's infidelity but becomes determined to seduce Merlin instead when he mocks her for these efforts. ""Merlin and Vivien"" is mostly made up of the dialogue between the two after Vivien pursues Merlin following his departure from Camelot in a fog of foreboding. Under a large oak tree, she wheedles out of him a curse that enables her to imprison him in the tree as though buried alive. In ""Lancelot and Elaine,"" Lancelot travels to a tournament incognito, passing through Astolat on the way. While he's there he meets Elaine, who falls in love with him. Lancelot is wounded in the tournament and takes refuge in a hermitage near Camelot, where Elaine travels to him and nurses him back to health, falling even more in love with him than ever, the poor girl. Of course Lancelot is totally head over heels for Guinevere, so he doesn't return her affections, and straight up refuses to take her as his mistress. Elaine dies of her unrequited love and has her body sent down the river to Camelot in a barge bearing a note that tells her story. She's the lady of Shallot, by the way. Arthur's knights embark upon an not-too-smart quest for the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper in ""The Holy Grail."" While Arthur mourns the chivalric deeds that will go undone while they chase shadows, more than half of them set off in search of the grail. Three knights have partial visions of the grail while only one--Galahad--manages to achieve a full vision, traveling to a ""spiritual city,"" never to return again. A young, naive knight's devotion to a cruel woman is the subject of ""Pelleas and Ettarre."" Despite her initial promise to grant him her love if he won a tournament for her , Ettarre rejects Pelleas. She thinks he's naive and, later, too good for her. Gawain promises to help Pelleas win Ettarre's love but sleeps with her instead. Whoops. When the already broken Pelleas learns that Guinevere, too, is false, he becomes the ""Red Knight of the North,"" setting up a court that's a parody of Arthur's, peopled with harlots and adulterers. Yowza. Arthur rides with some of his knights to kick some Red Knight butt, leaving Lancelot in charge of the Tournament of Innocents in ""The Last Tournament."" But the tournament goes wrong. Really wrong. People insult each other and break rules, and everything ends badly when Tristram, the winner, insults the ladies by refusing to grant any of them the title of Queen of Beauty. Harsh, dude. Tristram leaves Camelot in a huff, insulted by the court jester Dagonet. When he reaches Cornwall he presents his lover, King Mark's wife Isolt, with the tournament prize. As he ties the jewel around her neck, King Mark slips into the room and slits his throat. Meanwhile, Arthur's forces easily overtake the Red Knight, but their battle ends in slaughter, raping, and pillaging with Arthur powerless to stop it. The Last Tournament indeed. ""Guinevere"" is about Arthur's wife Guinevere, who's hiding in a convent after she and Lancelot have been caught in her bedchamber together. A rookie courtier drives her crazy by feeding the rumor mill about her infidelity. Arthur arrives at the convent and tells Guinevere that her actions have caused the total collapse of the Round Table and, with it, the ideal world that he tried to create. Yet Arthur forgives Guinevere and hopes they will one day be together in heaven. Touched by his faith in her, Guinevere devotes the rest of her life to doing good deeds. After he leaves the convent, Arthur rides to what he knows will be his last battle. In ""The Passing of Arthur,"" he kills Mordred and receives a fatal wound in the process. He asks his last remaining faithful knight, Bedivere, to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Bedivere fails twice before finally managing to throw it in on his third attempt. Three ladies arrive on the shore of the lake in a boat in which Bedivere places Arthur at his request. Bedivere watches the boat disappear into the sunrise."
Jude the Obscure,"Jude Fawley, an eleven-year-old boy, wants to follow the example of his teacher Mr. Phillotson, who leaves Marygreen for Christminster to take a university degree and to be ordained. Jude is being raised by his great-aunt, whom he helps in her bakery. He studies very hard on his own to prepare for the move, and to provide a means by which he can support himself at the university, he learns the trade of ecclesiastical stonework. He meets, desires, and marries Arabella Donn, who deceives him into marriage by making him think he has got her pregnant. They do not get along at all, and eventually Arabella leaves him to go with her family to Australia. Though delayed, Jude does get to Christminster, partly because of his aspirations but also partly because of the presence there of his cousin Sue Bridehead. He meets and falls in love with her, though the fact of his being married causes him to feel guilty. Sue will not return his love, and when he realizes that Phillotson, under whom she is now teaching, is interested in Sue, Jude is in despair. This plus the fact that he has made no headway on getting into the university and realizes he never will causes him to give up that part of his dream and leave Christminster. At Melchester he intends to pursue theological study and eventually enter the church at a lower level. Sue is there at a training college and is to marry Phillotson when she finishes, but she flees the school when punished for staying out all night with Jude. Jude is puzzled by Sue because her ideas are different from his and she will not return the feeling he has for her. Shortly after he tells her he is married, she announces her marriage to Phillotson and asks Jude to give her away. He sees Arabella again, who is back from abroad, spends the night with her, and learns that she married in Australia. When he next encounters Sue, she tells him perhaps she shouldn't have married, and Jude vows to go on seeing her in spite of his aim to discipline himself to get into the church. When Jude's aunt dies, Sue comes to Marygreen for the funeral, and there she admits to him she is unhappy and can't give herself to Phillotson. The kiss Jude and Sue exchange when she leaves for Shaston causes him to think he has reached the point where he is no longer fit for the church; therefore, he burns his theological books and will profess nothing. Sue asks Phillotson to let her live apart from him, preferably with Jude, but he only allows her to live apart in the house until an instance of her repugnance to him causes him to decide to let her go. Sue goes to Jude and they travel to Aldbrickham, but she will not yet allow intimacy. Phillotson is dismissed from his job at Shaston when Sue never returns, and after seeing her later and not being able to get her back he decides to divorce her to give her complete freedom. After living together a year at Aldbrickham Jude and Sue have still not consummated their relationship, and though they repeatedly plan to be married they never go through with it. Only when Arabella appears and seems to threaten her hold on Jude does Sue allow intimacy. Arabella marries Cartlett, her Australian husband, again and sends to Jude her and Jude's son, Little Father Time. When opinion turns against Jude and Sue and he loses a job because of their reputation, they decide to leave Aldbrickham, and they live in many places as Jude works where he can find employment in anything other than ecclesiastical work, which he decides to give up. They now have two children of their own and another on the way. Having seen Sue in Kennetbridge, Arabella, whose husband has died, revives her interest in Jude, and when she encounters Phillotson, who is now in Marygreen, she tells him he was wrong to let Sue go. Jude, now ill and not working regularly, wants to return to Christminster. They do return to Christminster, arriving on a holiday, and Jude is upset by his return to the city that has meant so much to him and gives a speech to a street crowd in an attempt to explain what his life has meant. Despairing talk by Sue triggers off a reaction in Little Father Time, and he hangs the other two children and himself. And the child Sue is carrying is born dead. Jude and Sue have reached the point where their views of life have about reversed, Jude becoming secular and Sue religious; and when Phillotson writes to ask Sue to come back to him, she agrees, thinking of it as a penance. Sue returns to Phillotson at Marygreen and marries him again, though she still finds him repugnant. Arabella comes to Jude, and by persistent scheming she gets him to marry her once more. They get along about as before, and though ill Jude goes to see Sue and they declare their love for each other. As a further penance, Sue then gives herself to Phillotson. Jude learns of this, and on the holiday the following year, while Arabella is out enjoying the festivities, Jude dies. Only Arabella and Mrs. Edlin are present to stand watch by his coffin."
White Fang,"White Fang opens with a beautifully detailed picture of the Yukon. Two men, Bill and Henry, with a team of six dogs pulling a sled on which is strapped a coffin, are fleeing down a frozen waterway, a wolf pack in pursuit. At night, the dogs are individually lured to their deaths by a she-wolf. London paints quite a portrait of the two men sitting around the campfire, seeing only the eyes of the wolves reflecting the light from the fire. Scared and frustrated, Bill decides one morning to go out with his rifle and three remaining cartridges. Henry hears three shots, but Bill does not return. Henry is left alone and night after night he feels the wolves coming closer and closer. Finally, one night, the wolves become so brazen that they come right up to the fire to collect their dinner. Henry literally climbs into the fire and begins hurling brands from the fire at the encircling wolves. At the last moment he is rescued as a search party looking for the dead body Henry and Bill were transporting. And that is the abrupt end of Part I. Henry drops out of the novel, and the scene shifts to the wolf pack and the birth of White Fang. It is difficult to understand why Jack London wrote the novel this way. The opening scene is masterfully written, but does not quite fit. Part II of the novel is a complete break from Part I, as the story is now told from the perspective of the she-wolf. The famine is now over and the wolf pack begins to separate, little by little. She-wolf begins to travel with three males who are all vying for her attention, but she has now interest in any of them. ""One-Eye,"" an older, more experienced wolf eventually kills the other two males and the she-wolf's attitude towards him softens. They travel the forest together, but the she-wolf is restless, looking for something she does not quite understand. She finds this something, a cave where she can give birth to her cubs. Shortly after the birth of the she-wolf's cubs, another the Northland experiences another famine and all of the little wolves die except the gray wolf cub. This gray cub is much stronger and more active than the other cubs, adhering to the theme of the ""survival of the fittest."" London's treatment of White Fang's puppyhood is accurately and amusingly written. White Fang, who is three-quarters wolf and one-quarter husky, enters the story in the first month of his life, and London describes his step-by-step development as he emerges from the lair and learns how to hunt. It is apparent that London had done his research. Before he is a year old, White Fang is captured by an Indian, Gray Beaver, who trains him as a sled dog. White Fang's life in the Indian village is anything but pleasant as he is targeted for abuse by an older dog, Lip-Lip. His only protection is his mother, but shortly she is traded by Gray Beaver to pay a debt. When the gray wolf tries to follow his mother downstream, he is recaptured by the Indian and brutally beaten, learning that these men-gods are to be obeyed. Responding to constant attacks from other dogs in the village, White Fang gains a reputation for a savage ability to kill other dogs. This reputation eventually proves to be a liability. While on an excursion to Fort Yukon, Gray Beaver is tricked into selling his dog to a man named Beauty Smith. Beauty Smith, who is so ugly that his name was an antithesis, is particularly impressed with the dog. Beauty does the cooking, the dishwashing, and the drudgery for the other men in the fort, where he is known for his ""cowardly rages"" and his ""distorted body and mind."" Under Beauty Smith's tutelage White Fang becomes a ""fiend,"" earning a reputation as ""The Fighting Wolf,"" living a public life in a cage. He is taunted and tortured not only by Beauty Smith, but also most onlookers. As the sourdoughs crowd around to place their bets, he beats all comers. But he eventually meets his match with a bulldog, who gets a grip on him that White Fang cannot shake. Just as he is about to die, the wolf is saved by Weedon Scott, who slugs Beauty Smith and manages to free White Fang from the bulldog. Scott, a mining engineer, buys the wolf-dog and takes him back to his cabin. It is here that White Fang first learns about love and becomes civilized. With great patience and great care, Scott teaches the dog to trust someone for the first time in his life. When Scott packs to leave the Yukon, White Fang senses what is coming, escapes from the house, and earns a trip to the Southland. Weedon Scott's father is Judge Scott, and it is to his estate, Sierra Vista, in the Santa Clara Valley in California that White Fang is taken. Although mostly wolf by nature, White Fang allows himself to become domesticated, and even allows Weedon's two small children to caress him. But he does this only out of love for his master, and his wild instincts never leave him, as witnessed by the fifty or so chickens he kills in the yard. But all is soon forgiven when White Fang rescues Weedon Scott after an accident on a horse. The gray wolf even develops a love-interest with a sheep-dog named Collie. One night when an escaped convict named Jim Hall breaks into the house to get the Judge for ""railroading"" him to prison, White Fang, despite taking three bullets from Hall's revolver, leaps on him and slashes his throat. White Fang is near death but is able to survive injuries that would have left other dogs dead, once again supporting the theme of the ""survival of the fittest."" The end of the novel comes quite abruptly when White Fang ventures from the house on his first excursion after his accident only to be greeted by his litter of puppies. White Fang lives on to play with his puppies in the California and earns the undying love of the Scott family through his courage and intelligence. The family, from that night on, refers to him as ""the Blessed Wolf,"" but he remains what he his - three-quarters wolf - and can never by fully domesticated."
Romeo and Juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is set in Verona, Italy, where there is an ongoing feud between the Montague and Capulet families. The play opens with servants from both houses engaged in a street brawl that eventually draws in the family patriarchs and the city officials, including Prince Escalus. The Prince ends the conflict by issuing a decree that prohibits any further fighting at the risk of great punishment. Meanwhile, Romeo, a young man from the Montague house, laments his unrequited love for a woman named Rosaline, who has vowed to remain chaste for the rest of her life. Romeo and his friend Benvolio happen to stumble across a Capulet servant, Peter, who is trying to read a list of invitees to a masked party at the Capulet house that evening. Romeo helps Peter read the list and decides to attend the party because Rosaline will be there. He plans to wear a mask so that he will nobody will recognize him as a Montague. Romeo arrives at the Capulets' party in costume. He falls in love with young Juliet Capulet from the moment he sees her. However, Juliet's cousin Tybalt recognizes Romeo and wants to kill him on the spot. Lord Capulet intervenes, insisting that Tybalt not disturb the party because it will anger the Prince. Undeterred, Romeo quietly approaches Juliet and confesses his love for her. After exchanging loving words, they kiss. Afterwards, Juliet's Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet, which upsets the smitten youngster. Meanwhile, Juliet is similarly distraught when she finds out that Romeo is a Montague. Later that night, Romeo climbs the garden wall into Juliet's garden. Juliet emerges on her balcony and speaks her private thoughts out loud. She wishes Romeo could shed his name and marry her. Upon hearing her confession, Romeo appears and tells Juliet that he loves her. She warns him to be true in his love, and he swears by his own self that he will be. Before they part, they agree that Juliet will send her Nurse to meet Romeo at nine o'clock the next day, at which point he will set a place for them to be married. The Nurse carries out her duty, and tells Juliet to meet Romeo at the chapel where Friar Laurence lives and works. Juliet meets Romeo there, and the Friar marries them in secret. Benvolio and Mercutio are waiting on the street later that day when Tybalt arrives. Tybalt demands to know where Romeo is so that he can challenge him to a duel, in order to punish him for sneaking into the party. Mercutio is eloquently vague, but Romeo happens to arrive in the middle of the verbal sparring. Tybalt challenges him, but Romeo passively resists fighting, at which point Mercutio jumps in and draws his sword on Tybalt. Romeo tries to block the two men, but Tybalt cuts Mercutio and runs away, only to return after he hears that Mercutio has died. Angry over his friend's death, Romeo fights with Tybalt and kills him. Then, he decides to flee. When Prince Escalus arrives at the murder scene, he banishes Romeo from Verona forever. The Nurse tells Juliet the sad news about what has happened to Tybalt and Romeo. Juliet is heart-broken, but she realizes that Romeo would have been killed if he had not fought Tybalt. She sends her Nurse to find Romeo and give him her ring. That night, Romeo sneaks into Juliet's room, and they consummate their marriage. The next morning, he is forced to leave when Juliet's mother arrives. Romeo travels to Mantua, where he waits for someone to send news about Juliet or his banishment. During Romeo and Juliet's only night together, however, Lord Capulet decides that Juliet should marry a young man named Paris, who has been asking for her hand. Lord and Lady Capulet tell Juliet of their plan, but she refuses, infuriating her father. When both Lady Capulet and the Nurse refuse to intercede for the girl, she insists that they leave her side. Juliet then visits Friar Laurence, and together they concoct a plan to reunite her with Romeo. The Friar gives Juliet a potion that will make her seem dead for at least two days, during which time Romeo will come to meet her in the Capulet vault. The Friar promises to send word of the plan to Romeo. Juliet drinks the Friar's potion that night. The next morning, the day of Juliet and Paris' wedding, her Nurse finds her ""dead"" in bed. The whole house decries her suicide, and Friar Laurence insists they quickly place her into the family vault. Unfortunately, Friar John has been unable to deliver the letter to Romeo informing him of the plan, so when Romeo's servant brings him news in Mantua that Juliet has died, Romeo is heart-broken. He hurries back to Verona, but first, buys poison from an Apothecary and writes a suicide note detailing the tragic course of events. As soon as Friar Laurence realizes that his letter never made it to Romeo's hands, he rushes to the Capulet tomb, hoping to arrive before Romeo does. Romeo arrives at the Capulet vault and finds it guarded by Paris, who is there to mourn the loss of his betrothed. Paris challenges Romeo to a duel, and Romeo kills him quickly. Romeo then carries Paris' body into the grave and sets it down. Upon seeing Juliet's ""dead"" body lying in the tomb, Romeo drinks the poison, gives her a last kiss - and dies. Friar Laurence arrives to the vault just as Juliet wakes up. He tries to convince her to flee, but upon seeing Romeo's dead body, she takes her own life as well. The rest of the town starts to arrive at the tomb, including Lord Capulet and Lord Montague. Friar Laurence explains the whole story, and Romeo's letter confirms it. The two families agree to settle their feud and form an alliance despite the tragic circumstances."
The Ramayana,"Born during an age when the demon Ravana terrorized the world, Rama is the virtuous, wise, and powerful prince of Ayohya. As a young man, he is able to accomplish what no other man has ever done: he lifts and strings the bow of Siva, and by so doing her earns the right to marry the beautiful Sita. Just when he is about to ascend the throne of Ayodhya, his father Dasaratha is forced to exile him for fourteen years to the forest due to a vow made long ago. Unruffled, Rama accepts his exile; his wife Sita and his loyal brother Lakshmana accompany him. In the forest, the princely brothers kill many demons and visit many wise men and women. The evil demon Ravana hears of Sita's beauty, and kidnaps her. He has fallen in love with her and tries to seduce her, but she rebuffs his advances for nearly ten months. Desperate to win her back, Rama and Lakshmana form an alliance with the monkey king Sugriva, and invade Lanka with an army of monkeys. After many violent battles, Rama defeats Ravana and wins back Sita. He is concerned that she has been unfaithful during her long captivity, and so Sita undergoes a trial by fire to prove her chastity. Rama takes her back, and they return to rule Ayodhya for many wonderful years. In another version of the tale, Rama hears his people gossiping about Sita's imagined indiscretions, and he banishes her to the forest, where she gives birth to Rama's twin sons. Sita and the children confront him years later; he tries to explain his harsh actions to Sita, but she vanishes into the earth to escape him."
Meditations,"The Meditations is basically Marcus's personal journal. It's a record of thoughts that is carefully composed, but it was never intended for a wider audience. Originally, it wasn't organized into the books, chapters, and sections we see today when we open any edition of the work. In fact, it can be hard to locate particular discussions within the Meditations, since they aren't necessarily grouped thematically. While all the books in the Meditations discuss existence, mortality, virtues, relationships with community and the gods, reason, duty, and death, certain books in the work stand out for their strong thematic concerns. Book 1 is an extended shout-out to the people who shaped Marcus in some way, while Book 3 lays down some of Marcus's foundational ideas, taken from his favorite Stoic philosophers. Book 6 addresses duty, among other things, and Book 8 represents a time of reflection and regret in Marcus's life, when he realizes he will never be a real philosopher. Book 9 gets pretty theological. In this one, Marcus discusses sin--both against the gods and humanity--and how man must behave in social ways for the good of the universe and himself. Book 10 has a religious feel to it, with Marcus's sensibility that ""all is well and all shall be well for you"" revealing his supreme confidence in the benevolence of the gods that order the universe. By the time we reach Book 12, Marcus is nearing the end of his life, and he's extremely interested in summing up and reiterating for himself his most important principles. He's not sentimental or nostalgic at all here, but he is concerned about being in a good place for death. Marcus ends with an envoy--a kind of farewell P.S.--that speaks of his readiness to receive his marching orders from the world, confident that the gods are his friends."
An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,"Is morality based on reason or on sentiment? Hume believes that philosophers have produced some confusing theories, but his big gripe is with the idea that morality is based 100% on reason. Seriously, what's up with that? Hume describes the ideal citizen as reliable, compassionate, thoughtful, and fair. Yep, if we were making a wish list, those are definitely the boxes we'd tick. Still, it's not just about niceness but what's useful to society. In an ideal world, folks would have everything they needed and envy--the green-eyed monster--would never rear its head. When everything is freely available, there's no need for rules. But there are some places and scenarios where things like land and water aren't freely available. That's when we need to lay down some ground rules. Hume explains that rules of justice and property have been created because they're useful. He then describes some situations where justice gets put on hold, like after a shipwreck , but adds that everyday society is more of a happy medium. Hume argues that justice isn't defined from up above but is more of a practical thing. Take property: the idea of mine/yours isn't something that's always been around but we've recognized that it's useful and have set up laws to maintain it. Though we have rules about justice and property, Hume states that the bond between nations isn't as strong as the bond between individuals. When cooperation isn't useful, a nation may decide to bail. Hume then explores some other social structures and characteristics. For example, the family unit helps make sure that kids are cared for and raised as social beings. He sees commitment in marriage as another virtue, though chastity is seen as more important for women than men. While some vices are always bad, others depend on the situation. Loyalty is important in close relationships but not so much in casual ones. It's about what's convenient and useful . Some argue that moral codes are established by schools and politicians, but Hume disagrees. He believes that they can have an influence but there's something in our nature that responds to ideas about morality. Hume recognizes that we may feel most strongly about issues relating to us and our loved ones, but he argues that we have a natural concern for others, too. Along with emotional and intellectual qualities, Hume discusses physical characteristics. Signs of health and energy are positives, but, other than that, it's a question of how well someone is suited to a task. Other qualities seen as valuable are good-humor, self esteem, courage, and philosophical tranquility. Hume adds that virtues aren't always based on usefulness but on agreeableness and pleasure. Either way, they endorse happiness, and who is going to argue against that? Hume's next topic is qualities that produce an immediate type of pleasure. These include politeness, wit, modesty, cleanliness, and decency. Hume rejects ""monkish virtues"" like solitude and self-denial because he doesn't see them as useful or agreeable. Despite recognizing that we sometimes feel strong passions toward ourselves and those close to us, Hume uses examples such as protests and public uproar to show that folk can have strong emotions about social issues, too. Returning to the subject of self-interest, Hume argues that selfish emotions aren't always bad. If we want to do well in life, we think about how other people perceive us. This encourages us to monitor our behavior and act in an agreeable way. Makes sense, right? The Enquiry ends with four appendices. The first recaps Hume's argument that sentiment shapes our moral thinking. The second emphasizes that self-interest isn't a fault so long as it doesn't overrule our concern for others. The third explains that benevolence is immediate and instinctual while justice is concerned with society. The fourth admits that it can be tough to find the perfect words to define virtues and talents but that this is just verbal confusion and isn't a big deal."
Cymbeline,"As Cymbeline opens, two Gentlemen are discussing the state of Cymbeline's kingdom. They note that the King's virtuous daughter, Imogen, has married the equally virtuous Posthumus Leonatus, to the considerable displeasure of the King and Queen; Imogen is the King's daughter by a former wife, and he and his current Queen wanted Imogen to marry the Queen's son by a previous marriage of her own, the cloddish Cloten. We also learn that the King previously was the father to twin boys, Guiderius and Arvigarus, who were stolen from him in their infancy and never heard from again. His new Queen is wicked and duplicitous, acting as though she is happy for Imogen and Posthumus but secretly orchestrating their undoing. In his rage, the King banishes Posthumus. Before parting for Rome, Posthumus and Imogen exchange bands-he gives her a bracelet and she gives him a ring-and promise to be true to one another. As a parting gift, Posthumus has his faithful servant, Pisanio, stay in England to attend on Imogen. The Queen, sensing that Pisanio is a troublesome presence given her ambition, gives Pisanio an elixir filled with what she thinks is poison, telling him that it's medicine. In fact, however, the elixir is not poison; the court doctor, Cornelius, wary of the wicked Queen who asked him to brew her poison, has concocted a potion that creates the appearance of death for a short while but is, in fact, harmless. Having arrived in Italy, Posthumus falls in with some old acquaintances, including the Machiavellian Iachimo and the good-hearted Philario. The conversation turns to women's lack of virtue, and Posthumus declares Imogen exempt from this judgment, saying that she is totally chaste. Iachimo wagers ten thousand pounds against the precious ring Posthumous received from Imogen that he can get Imogen to commit adultery. Posthumous accepts this proposition, and Iachimo departs for England. Once in England, Imogen resists Iachimo's attempts to woo her. However, the clever Iachimo has a backup plan. He asks Imogen to keep a chest in her room overnight for safekeeping, and she agrees. In the middle of the night Iachimo himself rises out of the chest, takes an inventory of Imogen's bedroom and some intimate details of Imogen in the nude, and removes the bracelet Posthumus gave her from her wrist. Back in Italy, Iachimo uses this evidence and his knowledge of Imogen's body to convince Posthumus, against the protestations of Philario, that he has indeed bedded Imogen. Enraged, Posthumus sends word to Pisanio that he must take Imogen to Wales on the pretense of meeting him there and kill her. Meanwhile, the Roman Empire has sent an ambassador, Caius Lucius, to collect tribute from England. Cymbeline, influenced by his Queen and Cloten, refuses this tribute, saying that England is self-sufficient and equal to any challenge Rome might pose. Lucius thus declares Cymbeline the enemy of Rome and departs to plan an attack on the rebellious Britons. Pisanio, having received the order to kill Imogen, takes her to Wales. However, rather than killing her, he tells her that Posthumus has been tricked into thinking her inconstant. Imogen is rent with grief at the news of her lover's doubt in her. Pisanio tells her that her best hope is to disguise herself as a man and offer her services as a page to Lucius, who will be stationed in Wales. Imogen agrees, puts on male garb, and renames herself Fidele. As a parting gift, Pisanio gives Imogen the elixir that the queen gave him, telling her that it is medicine. Upon returning to England, it is discovered that Imogen has gone missing, and Cloten questions Pisanio as to her whereabouts. Pisanio says that she has gone to Wales to meet Posthumus. Enraged by an earlier insult in which Imogen told him that he was not worth Posthumus's ""mean'st garment,"" Cloten procures some of Posthumus's clothes and goes off to Wales, planning to kill Posthumus while wearing his clothes and then rape Imogen. While dressed as Fidele, Imogen comes upon a cave in the wilderness of Wales wherein there is food. Starving, she helps herself, only to be interrupted by three rustics. We learn that these rustics are in fact former members of Cymbeline's court. Belarius, who was falsely accused of treason, stole Cymbeline's sons as revenge, renaming them Cadwal and Polydore and calling himself Morgan. These heirs to England's throne have been raised in ignorance of civilization, yet they still show regal bearing. They immediately fall in love with Fidele, recognizing ""his"" true nobility. The next day, having determined to keep Fidele as a cook, they go off to hunt. Fidele, who is grief-stricken at her betrayal by Posthumus, takes the elixir Pisanio has given her and falls into a deep sleep. Meanwhile, while out hunting, Belarius, Arvigarus and Guiderius come upon Cloten, who is looking for Posthumus and Imogen. Belarius recognizes Cloten from his days in court and tries to get the brothers to retreat with him; Guiderius, however, confronts Cloten, who roundly insults him. Guiderius insults Cloten back, and Cloten threatens to behead him. As a reply, Guiderius beheads Cloten and drags his body back to the cave. When he returns to the cave, he finds Arvigarus and Belarius in mourning over the apparently dead body of Fidele. They sing a requiem and lay the two dead bodies beside each other. Fidele soon awakes and, seeing Cloten's clothes, thinks that Cloten's beheaded body is actually Posthumus's. She cries over his corpse while, meanwhile, Lucius advances for battle with England in the same region. Lucius is most impressed by Fidele's devotion to her dead ""master""-as she names the body-and so takes her as his own page. For their part, Guiderius and Arvigarus have heard of the coming battle between Rome and Britain, and against their father's protestations they determine to fight on the English side. Belarius reluctantly joins them. Posthumus, in the meantime, has arrived in grief from England, fully regretting his order to have Imogen killed. Pisanio has sent a bloodied handkerchief as a false sign that Posthumus's will has been done, and Posthumus, in his grief, has decided to fight on Britain's side in the coming battle disguised as an English peasant. The battle begins and all looks well for the Romans until Posthumus, Belarius, Guiderius and Arvigarus rally the retreating British and rout Rome. Following his important role in the battle, Posthumus changes back into his Roman attire, after which he is arrested and jailed as a Roman. While in jail, Posthumus is visited in his sleep by the spirits of his glorious ancestors, who intercede on his behalf with Jupiter. Jupiter inscribes a prophesy on a tablet, implying that all will yet be well for Posthumus, though things look grim indeed. Upon waking up, after a short, morbid chat with a comedic jailer, Posthumus is sent for by Cymbeline. In Cymbeline's tent, the King knights Arvigarus and Guiderius for their bravery in battle, noting that he wishes the other peasant warrior were about as well. Soon after, Cornelius arrives on the scene with the news that the Queen has died of grief following the prolonged absence of her son. The physician continues that on her deathbed the Queen confessed to her wickedness, a revelation that shocks Cymbeline. The Roman prisoners enter and Cymbeline plans to have them killed; Lucius pleads for the life of Imogen, whom he describes as his faultless page, and beholding though not recognizing his disguised daughter, Cymbeline agrees to spare ""his"" life. Iachimo is among the captive Romans, and Imogen spots the ring she had given Posthumus on his finger. She demands to know how he got it. Iachimo confesses to his horrible bedroom wager with Imogen, saying that he hid in the chest. This drives Posthumus from his Roman disguise, as he tries to kill Iachimo in his rage. Imogen interrupts him but Posthumus doesn't recognize her and pushes her away. Pisanio, however, does recognize Imogen, and reconciles the two lovers again, also thus reconciling the King and his lost daughter. Pisanio furthermore reveals that he knows Cloten to be in Wales, upon which Guiderius admits that he killed Cloten. The King is livid until Belarius reveals that ""Cadwal and Polydore"" are in fact his sons, Guiderius and Arvigarus. The King and Imogen are both overjoyed at this news. All reconciled, all forgiven, Cymbeline tells the Romans that he had been poisoned in his judgment by the Queen, and declares that Britain will remain subject to Rome. Posthumus then gives the tablet containing Jupiter's prophesy to Philarmonus, the Roman soothsayer. Philarmonus interprets the tablet as predicting the reconciliation of Posthumus and Imogen and the restoration of Cymbeline and his sons, and further declares that the gods have made all harmonious and peaceful between Rome and England. On this note, Cymbeline declares a procession through London to show the peace between these two states."
The Sorrows of Young Werther,"The Sorrows of Young Werther, a novel that consists almost entirely of letters written by Werther to his friend Wilhelm, begins with the title character in a jubilant mood after having just escaped from a sticky romantic situation with a woman named Leonora. Werther has settled in a rural town, determined to spend some time painting, sketching, and taking excursions around the countryside. Werther does not accomplish much work, preferring to admire the easy lifestyle of the peasant class, which reminds him of the ancient ""patriarchal life"" found in the Bible. Werther makes the acquaintance of many of the local peasants, including two peasant brothers, Hans and Philip, and a country lad who is in love with the widow who employs him. Werther finds Wahlheim, a village a short distance away from his town, to be the most charming place in the countryside. This estimation increases a hundredfold when he meets the village bailiff's daughter, Lotte, at a dance. Their interaction is immediately striking - they are both enthusiasts of the new sentimental style of literature, represented by Goldsmith and Klopstock, as well as ancient writers like Homer and Ossian. Lotte, however, is engaged to an upstanding man, Albert. Werther must satisfy himself with friendship alone. In the coming weeks, Werther grows more and more impressed with Lotte, cherishing her unique charm and insight as she uncomplainingly carries the burden of motherhood. She is the eldest of eight children, and assumed the responsibility of caring for her siblings after her mother's death. However, Albert returns, and Werther must meet the man who has Lotte's heart. After determining that he will leave, Werther instead stays, forming a friendship with Albert, who he finds to be both intelligent and open-minded, though much more sensible than the romantic Werther. Upon Albert's arrival, however, Werther grows increasingly infatuated with Lotte. He can't resist feeling that Lotte would be happier with him; they are both initiates in the intense, subjective emotionalism of Sturm und Drang, and Albert is not. However, the faithful Lotte has no intention of leaving her fiance, and Werther determines, at Wilhelm's recommendation, to take an official court position rather than remain in an impossible triangle. He leaves Wahlheim without informing Albert or Lotte of his plan. Werther's official position, however, is a great disappointment to him. He clashes with his employer, the envoy, who is as meticulous and cerebral as Werther is spontaneous and emotional. Werther also loathes the social scene of his new job, in which the aristocratic class rules over all, though he cultivates rewarding friendships with two aristocrats, Count C and Fraulein von B. The positive aspect of his job crumbles, however, when the aristocratic class, including Fraulein von B, snubs Werther at one of Count C's parties. Humiliated, Werther resigns from his position, moving with another friend, Prince ---, to the Prince's country estates. This situation, too, is short-lived, as Werther finds himself irrevocably drawn back to Wahlheim and Lotte. When Werther returns to Wahlheim, he discovers that his infatuation with Lotte has only grown stronger during the separation. As Lotte later suggests, it seems that the impossibility of his possessing her is what feeds his obsession. Albert and Werther become increasingly estranged, and Lotte is caught in the middle. Also, the countryside has taken a turn away from the idyllic: Hans is dead, and the country lad's tale of love has ended in murder. Meanwhile, Werther meets Heinrich, a former employee of Lotte's father's, who was driven mad by an unrequited passion for her. Werther feels increasingly hopeless. Three days before Christmas of 1772, in an attempt to salvage what is left of their relationship, Lotte orders Werther not to visit her until Christmas Eve, when he will be just another friend. Werther decides that he cannot live on such terms with Lotte, electing instead to kill himself. He pays Lotte a final visit, during which he forces a kiss and is ordered never to see her again. At home, alone, Werther writes Lotte a letter. He asks her for Albert's hunting pistols, and she sends them to him. Then, with a calmness hitherto unknown to his restless soul, Werther shoots himself in the head. He lingers until the morning; Lotte, Albert and Lotte's brothers and sisters watch him die. At the novel's end, Werther is buried without a church service. Lotte's own life is in jeopardy as well; she is driven to desperate grief by Werther's action."
The Hairy Ape,"The play opens in the firemen's forecastle inside a transatlantic liner leaving New York City. We are introduced to Yank who stands out as the leader of the men, a man who believes he is not only fueling the ship in his job, but the world. Long has more socialist views that Yank does not readily agree with, and Paddy an elder fireman dreams of days gone by when the sailing ships used the wind to power them across vast seas. SCENE 2 We meet Mildred Douglas, the daughter of the steel tycoon who owns Nazareth Steel. She is sitting with her Aunt sunbathing on the deck of the same transatlantic liner. Mildred and her Aunt argue over Mildred's desire to do social work, which has led her to demand the Captain allow her to visit the stokehole on the ship accompanied by the Second Engineer. Mildred uses her family name to get what she wants from the Captain and demands that the Second Engineer let her wear her white dress into the dirty depths of the ship's bowels as she will throw it into the sea after her tour and wear one of the other 50 dresses she has on board just like it. SCENE 3 Mildred, the Second and Fourth Engineers have descended into the stokehole where Yank and the other men are stoking the furnace that feeds the ship's motion. All of the men take notice of Mildred--she stands out like a soar thumb wearing all white as they are covered in coal dust--except for Yank. He only turns to see her when he notices all of the men staring off at something behind him. When Yank turns Mildred is so shocked she faints after calling Yank a filthy beast and the Second and Fourth Engineers must carry her out. SCENE 4 Yank is found in the firemen's forecastle going over and over what has just happened in the stokehole. The men believe he is in love, but Yank says he is in 'hate' with Mildred for what she has just made him to feel. He attempts to charge for Mildred to get revenge, but all of the men pile on him to stop him. SCENE 5 Three weeks later Yank and Long are found on Fifth Avenue in New York after the liner has returned to the States. The men argue about how to go after and attack the upper class, and Yank is still set on getting Mildred back. Churchgoers begin to come out onto the street and Yank begins to forcefully try to speak to them. Long leaves and Yank punches a gentleman in the face. He is then arrested. SCENE 6 The night of the following day Yank is in prison on Blackwell Island. He is serving a 30 sentence for punching the man on the street. Yank wakes up thinking he is in the Zoo, he's bruised and bandaged as he was badly beaten by the cops the previous day. One of the other prisoners tells Yank about the International Workers of the World after hearing how Yank got into jail, and tells Yank he should join if he wants to get his revenge. Yank becomes enraged once again about Mildred and her father the steel magnate and begins to bend the bars to his cell in an attempt to escape. The curtain closes with the guards using force to stop Yank. SCENE 7 30 days later Yank visits the IWW office once he is released from prison and becomes a member. But, he is soon thrown out as the leader of the group suspects Yank of being a spy for the government. The reason being, Yank only wants to blow up the Nazareth Steel factory, even saying he doesn't care if he goes to prison for life. The group swiftly throws him out onto the street. A policeman shows up and tells Yank to move on or he'll crack him over the head. SCENE 8 The next night Yank is at the Zoo. He is sympathizing with a caged gorilla as he believes they are the same. Yank releases the gorilla from behind its bars and approaches the animal to shake its hand. The gorilla then attacks Yank, crushing his ribs. The gorilla tosses Yank into its cage where Yank dies behind bars."
All for Love,"The play begins with Serapion, a priest of Isis, discussing the fact that there have been many dark omens manifesting in the natural world recently. Alexas, Cleopatra's eunuch, suggests that this is nonsense, and warns that Cleopatra's relationship with Antony, the Roman general, is on the rocks. When Ventidius, one of Antony's former generals, comes to fetch him, Serapion throws a feast in honor of Antony's birthday. Ventidius wants to lure Antony back to Rome and tells the mournful Antony that there is a legion waiting to fight with him in Syria, but only if he is willing to leave Cleopatra behind and move on. Antony is not taking any visitors, as he is trying to will himself to stop loving Cleopatra, but Ventidius does not take no for an answer and eventually convinces Antony to leave Cleopatra and join the Romans. Cleopatra is inconsolable when she learns that Antony is leaving her. She sends Alexas to bring Antony a bracelet on her behalf. When he delivers the bracelet, Antony has trouble fastening it, and Alexas tells him that Cleopatra ought to do it. Antony goes to Cleopatra and when he sees her in person, is dissuaded from leaving Egypt. She tells him that she refused an offer from Octavius, which proves her love for him. Ventidius tries yet again to get Antony to leave Egypt. He brings both Antony's old friend, Dolabella, as well as Antony's wife, Octavia, and daughters, to convince him to come back to Rome. Antony previously banished Dolabella for seeming to fall in love with Cleopatra, but Antony has forgiven him upon his return. Octavia manages to convince Antony to return to Rome, and Octavia and Cleopatra have a confrontation. Antony plans to leave Egypt and sends Dolabella to deliver the news to Cleopatra, as he believes that Dolabella will be best suited to communicate his regret at having to leave. When Dolabella goes to Cleopatra, Cleopatra and Alexas make a plan to make Antony jealous: Cleopatra will attempt to seduce Dolabella, which will lure Antony back to her. When Cleopatra attempts to seduce Dolabella, she has second thoughts and does not pursue anything. However, Ventidius and Octavia see the interaction and tell Antony that Dolabella is having an affair with the Egyptian queen. Antony is heartbroken, but still wants to believe the best of Cleopatra, which offends Octavia, who denounces him once and for all, and leaves him. Dolabella and Cleopatra try and tell Antony that there was no affair, but he does not believe them. In the final act, Antony leads his troops in battle against Caesar, but instead of fight the Romans, they greet them as friends and turn against Egypt. Hearing of Egypt's doom, Cleopatra attempts to flee, leaving Alexas behind. In order to save his own life, Alexas tells Antony that Cleopatra killed herself. Antony is heartbroken, and he and Ventidius kill themselves. Just as Antony is dying, Cleopatra rushes on, having heard of Alexas' lie. After Antony dies in her arms, Cleopatra asks Charmion and Iras, her attendants, to bring her aspics , so that she can get bitten by them and die. She and her two attendants die from snake bites."
Major Barbara,"As the play opens, a woman named Lady Britomart is trying to arrange the family finances with the ""help"" of her son, Stephen. We put ""help"" in ""quotes"" because the super bossy and commanding Lady Britomart doesn't actually need any assistance in coming up with opinions, but for some reason she's making a big show of getting Stephen to weigh in. The topic of the day? How to make sure her daughters have enough money to live once they're married to their fiances, who aren't likely to be the best providers . Lady Britomart bullies Stephen into ""advising"" her to get some help from his father, Andrew Undershaft. The only catch? He and Lady Brit have been separated for a looooooong time. It seems that Lady Brit kicked her husband to the curb when she realized he was going to disinherit Stephen from the family business as part of an Undershaft family tradition of only passing the business on to a foundling--an abandoned child taken in and adopted by the family. However, Andrew has been financially supporting the family since then, and Lady Brit seems to think that getting some extra moolah from him is the only way to keep her girls going in their marriages. So, in an effort to grease the wheels for that request, she's invited Andrew to the house to see the children for the first time in years and meet the girls' fiances. It's super awkward when he arrives, since he doesn't initially know which of the people there are actually his offspring. Luckily for him, he figures it out soon enough and they all have a decently pleasant conversation. One point of tension, though, is the fact that his daughter Barbara is a ""Major"" for the Salvation Army, so she's not the biggest fan of the fact that her dad makes weapons for a living and therefore profits off violence and death. However, after some banter on the topic, they strike a deal: Undershaft will visit her Army headquarters, and she will visit his factory. In the second act, we see how Undershaft's visit to Barbara goes. We get a glimpse into the lives of some of the people who go to the Army for help and food, including Snobby Price and Rummy Mitchens. Both Price and Mitchens have claimed to be more downtrodden and poorly behaved than they actually are to solicit the interest of the Army's workers. Also, there's a mean dude named Bill floating around trying to find his girlfriend, and he ends up hitting one of the Army workers, Jenny Hill, because he thinks she was involved in convincing his girlfriend to leave him . Barbara tries to convert Bill, but she is unsuccessful. He ends up trying to buy his salvation with a sovereign , but Barbara won't accept it and Snobby Price proceeds to steal the sovereign. A bit later, Mrs. Baines--an Army commissioner--arrives and is super excited to report that they've received a huge donation that will likely clear up their money woes. However, there's a catch: The person donating it is a whiskey distiller, and he's requiring that the Army find some other people willing to donate an equal amount. Undershaft offers to put up the rest of the money, and Barbara is horrified to realize the Salvation Army will be saved by a whiskey distiller and an arms manufacturer, both of whose businesses go against the Army mission. However, Mrs. Baines is unconcerned about the moral dilemma this presents, and the rest of the people present go marching off in a procession to get more converts with this good news in hand. Barbara is devastated that the Army was so easily bought... Act 3 opens at Lady Brit's house, where Sarah and Barbara are hanging out. It appears that Barbara has quit the Salvation Army. Dolly shows up hung over from the previous night's celebrations, and then Undershaft arrives to take everyone to his factory. While the young ones are off getting ready to leave, Lady Brit gets him to promise to take financial care of the girls going forward. Success. Also, Undershaft, Stephen, and Lady Brit discuss Stephen's future, if he's not to inherit the family business. Then they all head off to the factory, where everyone is really impressed--even Barbara. They end up figuring out that Dolly can be Undershaft's ""foundling,"" since his parents' marriage isn't legal in England, and so he ends up agreeing to take over the family business. Barbara is fine with this, since she's decided to return to the Army and set her mind to converting the workers at the factory, who will be more ready to accept religion ""for real"" . And so, er, there's your happy ending."
The Jew of Malta,"The play is set on the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. In the opening act, the Turkish sultan's son Selim Calymath arrives to exact Malta's tribute. The tribute has been neglected for the past ten years, so it has accumulated to a considerable sum. The Maltese governor Ferneze cannot produce the funds immediately, but he promises to pay within a month. After the Turks leave, Ferneze decides to collect the tribute from the Jews of Malta: each Jew must give up half of his estate. The protagonist Barabas protests strongly, so his entire estate is confiscated. Barabas plots to retrieve part of his fortune through his daughter Abigall, and the two young men Mathias and Lodowick each set out to win Abigall's heart. Having uttered a false confession, Abigall gains entrance to the nunnery and retrieves her father's hidden fortune. In the meantime, the Spanish vice-admiral Martin del Bosco convinces Ferneze to break Malta's league with Turkey, promising to write the Spanish king for military aid from Spain against the Turks. Del Bosco also sells Ferneze the slaves he has in cargo, and Barabas ends up buying the Turkish slave Ithamore at the marketplace. At the marketplace, Barabas also runs into Mathias and Lodowick severally. Each young man desires to see Abigall, and Barabas promises his favors to each. Barabas thus contrives a plot to have Mathias and Lodowick kill each other. Ithamore delivers counterfeit letters to Mathias and Lodowick, who finally confront and stab each other. Learning of her father's scheming-and the death of her lover Mathias-Abigall decides to enter the nunnery once again. Now afraid that Abigall will betray the truth, Barabas poisons all the nuns with a porridge of rice. Abigall is the last to die. Before she dies, she manages to hand friar Barnardine a written confession of her father's crimes. The friars resolve to confront Barabas after they bury the nuns. Meanwhile, the Turkish Bashaws have arrived. In response to Ferneze's refusal to pay, they declare war on Malta. The friars Jacomo and Barnardine arrive at Barabas's house and insinuate that they know about the Jew's crimes. In response, Barabas proclaims that he would like to repent and become a Christian. Naturally, he will contribute the entirety of his fortune to whichever monastery he enters. The two friars, being from different monasteries, thus fight to win Barabas's allegiance, each hoping to benefit from Barabas's considerable fortune. Barabas once again has set a trap; he will be able able to kill both of the friars without arousing suspicion. As the Jew's accomplice, however, Ithamore knows plenty of incriminating information. Once he is seduced by the courtesan Bellamira, Ithamore begins to blackmail Barabas with threats to confess if the Jew does not send him gold. In the last scene of the fourth act, Barabas arrives at Bellamira's house in the disguise of a French musician and poisons his blackmailers. In the final act, Ferneze prepares to defend Malta against the Turks. Ithamore, Bellamira, and her attendant Pilia-Borza enter and all play their parts in revealing Barabas's crimes, but the Jew's poison takes effect and they all fall dead. Barabas meanwhile has been captured, but he feigns death through the ruse of a drug. He finds himself dumped outside the city walls. The Jew thus betrays Malta and leads the Turks into the city. He takes a new position as governor but finds it undesirable, so he decides to return Malta to Ferneze and contrives now to massacre the Turkish forces. The Turkish troops too succumb to the Jew's trap. But Ferneze turns the tables on Barabas at the last moment, and Barabas dies. Ferneze takes Calymath as a prisoner in order to ensure Malta's future safety."
The Coquette,"The novel, told in epistolary form, begins with Eliza Wharton spending time with her married friends, General and Mrs. Richman. She is a young, beautiful, smart, and prone to flirtatiousness. She is recently freed from an engagement to a man she did not love, who sadly died of illness. She writes her friend Lucy Freeman frequently of her charming and appealing social engagements with the Richmans and the neighborhood, and how she seems to have captured the attention of two men: Mr. Boyer, a respectable man soon to be a reverend, and Major Sanford, a dashing man with a reputation as a libertine. While Mr. Boyer eagerly expresses an interest in marrying her, Major Sanford remains content with simply flirting with her. Major Sanford's letters to his friend Charles reveal he does not intend to marry Eliza. While very attracted to her, he only appears wealthy and must marry a wealthy woman to maintain his standard of living. Eliza vacillates between the two men, telling her friends and mother that she remains uncertain as to whether she wants to give up her freedom for marriage, particularly to Mr. Boyer since they do not seem well-suited. She cannot forget the Major, even though everyone warns her about his terrible reputation. Eliza eventually halfheartedly decides to accept Mr. Boyer's hand, but her inability to escape the Major leads Mr. Boyer to call off their tentative engagement after he finds them speaking privately in the garden one night. He rails against her coquetry and lack of honesty and virtue. Not long after, he marries another woman. Eliza is distressed and rues her behavior. She convinces herself that she loves Mr. Boyer, and even writes him once asking if he will have her hand. When he tells her he wishes her no ill will but is already married, she plunges into deeper despair. The Major keeps up his words of love but offers no promises, and eventually leaves for a long period of travel. Although Eliza's friends and mother, with whom she has returned to stay, exhort her to regain her former vivacity and throw off her mantle of depression, she becomes a veritable recluse. One of Eliza and Lucy's friends, a young unmarried woman named Julia, comes to stay with Eliza and her mother. Julia reveals how difficult a time Eliza is having in her letters to Lucy. Everyone tries to boost her spirits, but they are particularly affected once she hears that Major Sanford has married a young woman of fortune and returned home to the house he purchased in Eliza's neighborhood. Eliza does not want to see him, but eventually he visits. They pass the time pleasantly enough and she decides to be his wife's friend. She believes herself over him, but as time passes, they fall back into flirtation. The Major cares little for marriage and his own wife, and gushes to Charles how he desires nothing more than to win Eliza over. Julia consistently warns Eliza to protect her virtue and not to succumb to that rake's insinuations. Eliza grows more and more depressed and weary, tiring even of writing letters. Eventually Julia discovers the Major sneaking out of the house one night; he has succeeded in seducing Eliza. Julia confronts her, full of condemnation, and Eliza wails that she knows she has done wrong by sleeping with him. She is also, unfortunately, pregnant. She begs Julia not to tell her mother, and says she will do it herself soon. Eliza sneaks out one night, fleeing to an unknown location, supported by Major Sanford, where she will avoid the censure of her loved ones and contemplate her tremendous fall. Julia and her mother receive letters from her, detailing her sorrow and apologizing for her behavior. They ask Major Sanford where Eliza is and he does not tell them, but promises she is comfortable and well taken care of. The newspaper reveals one day that Eliza gave birth to her child at a tavern near Boston. Unfortunately, both the child and Eliza perished. Mrs. Wharton, Lucy, and Julia are devastated. The Major also despairs that his beloved has died. His own wife leaves him. As a result, he falls into miserable poverty and must travel abroad to avoid the recriminations of the neighborhood and those within his own head. He expresses guilt and grief to Charles. Lucy and Julia see Eliza as an example of how virtue is the most important thing in the world. Lucy pays for a gravestone to be erected, extolling Eliza's charity, humility, and benevolence."
The Communist Manifesto,"The Manifesto breaks down into a preface, a cool little beginning, and four sections. In the helpful little preface, Marx's co-author Friedrich Engels lists all the translations and publications of the Manifesto that have come out in the forty years since its first publication. Conveniently enough, he says the book's spread matches the spread of the working class movement. Engels also gives us the fundamental idea underlying the Manifesto: political and intellectual ideas--and therefore all of history--are based on the economic system of the time, and thus on class struggles. Today, Engels says, the many exploited and oppressed proletariat can only free themselves by both overthrowing the few rich bourgeoisie and ending economic class altogether. Now on to the Manifesto itself. The beginning is made up of just a few short, fun paragraphs telling us that communism is haunting Europe and that leaders are accusing each other of being communists--but no one actually knows what communism is. Enter the Manifesto to set them all straight. In Section 1, Marx says that all of history is based on class struggle, and then he details the rise of the bourgeoisie. These rich have become the most powerful class, he says, putting the aristocracy in the shadows. The bourgeoisie control the means of production and exploit and oppress the working proletariat, keeping the profit for themselves. To stay on top, the members of the bourgeoisie have to expand across the planet, finding natural resources, new customers, and new workers. They've made life impersonal and miserable for the workers, since now everything boils down to money. The bourgeoisie fights the workers and other members of the bourgeoisie, and the proletarians fight the bourgeoisie and themselves. Some people occupy other spots in the mix of classes , but this show is ultimately about the capitalists versus the workers. In Section 2, Marx explains what communism advocates by looking at various objections that have been raised against it. For example, Marx says the bourgeoisie accuses the proletariat of wishing to get rid of all private property. But the communists only want to get rid of bourgeois property, by putting the means of production in the hands of the community, while leaving property like personal belongings alone. Marx concludes with some practical steps the proletariat should take once it gains political power. Karl says the proletarians should take capital away from the rich and abolish inheritance until class distinctions vanish and the vanguard or temporary government withers away. In Section 3, Marx criticizes socialist and communist views of various other authors, thinkers, and activists. Mostly, he attacks these writers for wanting to merely reform the capitalist system--efforts he thinks are necessarily doomed to fail--instead of downright overthrowing it. Marx also attacks these writers for wanting to set up idealistic little colonies instead of uniting workers of all countries. In Section 4, Marx notes which political parties the communists ally with in various countries, but he makes it clear that the communists will speak their own minds. Then he calls for a forcible overthrow of the bourgeoisie, a communist revolution. And then he finishes things up with some fabulous all-caps: WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!"
An Ideal Husband,"The play opens with a party at the Chiltern house, where all the major characters are introduced. At this party, Mrs. Cheveley blackmails Sir Robert and forces him to support her Argentine Canal scheme, in which she has invested heavily. She has in her possession a letter he wrote early in his public career in which he sold state secrets for a great fortune that has supported him to this day. Faced with certain ruin, Sir Robert has no choice but to accept Mrs. Cheveley's terms, and agrees to go before the House of Commons and publicly support the canal. Later in the night, Lady Chiltern, who prides herself on having an ""ideal husband"" and is unaware of Sir Robert's prior corruption, appeals to his morality and forces him to write a letter retracting his promise to Mrs. Cheveley. Toward the end of the act, Lord Goring and Mabel Chiltern discover a seemingly misplaced diamond brooch that Goring recognizes as something he gave to someone long ago. Lord Goring keeps the brooch and tells Mabel to inform him if anyone asks for it. In Act II Lord Goring and Sir Robert discuss his plight, and Sir Robert relates why he sent the letter to Baron Arnheim, selling the state secret, so many years ago. Lord Goring suggests Sir Robert should reveal his immoral deed to Lady Chiltern, but he cannot fathom disappointing her and shattering her perfect image of him. Instead, Sir Robert wires to Vienna seeking information on Mrs. Cheveley, hoping to uncover something he can use to fight against her blackmail. Lady Chiltern enters and Sir Robert escapes rather quickly. Lord Goring talks with Lady Chiltern, trying to see how she might react upon learning of Sir Robert's indiscretion. Lady Chiltern holds her husband in the highest regard and does not believe him capable of corruption. Lord Goring warns Lady Chiltern that she has rather harsh views, and that life must be lead with love rather than judgment. After Lord Goring departs, Lady Markby and Mrs. Cheveley visit. Mrs. Cheveley lost a diamond brooch at the Chiltern's party and asks if it has been found. The women chat for a brief while, and then Lady Markby departs to make a quick visit to a nearby friend. Left alone, Lady Chiltern and Mrs. Cheveley exchange heated words. Mrs. Cheveley reveals Sir Robert's past just as he enters the room to find his wife and his blackmailer together. He orders Mrs. Cheveley to leave, and she complies only after threatening him again. Lady Chiltern begs Sir Robert to deny Mrs. Cheveley's accusations, but he does not, and finally tells her the truth about his past. She recoils from him in despair, her ideal image of him shattered. The act closes with a tirade in which Sir Robert curses how women put men upon impossible pedestals. He tells his wife she has ruined him, and storms out. Lady Chiltern, in great pain, tries to follow, but finds her husband gone. At the opening of Act III Wilde introduces Phipps, the Ideal Butler, and describes the scene inside Lord Goring's house where he and Phipps discuss the relevance of his buttonhole as Goring prepares to head out for the evening. Goring receives an unexpected letter from Lady Chiltern urgently stating that she wants him, needs him, and is coming to him. Surprised, he prepares for her arrival. However, Lord Caversham suddenly arrives and is determined to talk about the direction of his son's life. Lord Goring discreetly tells Phipps that he expects a lady visitor and to bring her into the drawing room if she arrives when Lord Caversham is still visiting. A lady does appear, but it is Mrs. Cheveley rather than Lady Chiltern. Phipps does not know who was expected and assumes Mrs. Cheveley is the visitor Lord Goring spoke of. While waiting to be taken into the drawing room, Mrs. Cheveley finds Lady Chiltern's letter to Lord Goring and tries to steal it, but does not have the opportunity. Sir Robert arrives after Lord Caversham leaves and begs Lord Goring for help. He is in a desperate state, and wants advice. Just as Lord Goring is about to escort his friend out, a chair falls in the drawing room, and Sir Robert wants to know who has been listening. Lord Goring tries to keep him from seeing who is in the room, for he believes Lady Chiltern occupies it. Sir Robert finally manages to get into the room, and when he sees Mrs. Cheveley he leaves the house in disgust. Lord Goring is completely surprised when he realizes Mrs. Cheveley was in the drawing room rather than Lady Chiltern. They begin talking, and Mrs. Cheveley tries to convince Lord Goring to marry her by offering to give him Sir Robert's letter in return. He refuses the offer and tells her she has desecrated the idea of love, and for that she is beyond forgiveness. Lord Goring shows Mrs. Cheveley the brooch he found at the Chiltern party, and she explains that it is hers and that she misplaced it. Knowing the origin of the brooch, Lord Goring accuses her of stealing it from his cousin Lady Berkshire, whom he gave it to. She denies the theft, but the brooch is in fact a bracelet with a hidden clasp and after Lord Goring clamps it onto her arm, Mrs. Cheveley cannot remove it. Lord Goring threatens to call the police if Mrs. Cheveley does not give him Sir Robert's letter. Beaten in her own game, Mrs. Cheveley hands over the letter, but before angrily leaving his house, secretly steals Lady Chiltern's urgent letter when Lord Goring is not looking. In Act IV Lord Caversham informs Lord Goring of Sir Robert's speech denouncing the Argentine Canal scheme. All the papers are praising Sir Robert. Shortly thereafter, Lord Goring proposes to Mabel Chiltern, and she accepts him. Then, he tells Lady Chiltern that Sir Robert is safe, because he has possession of the letter to Baron Arnheim. However, he warns her that Mrs. Cheveley has the letter Lady Chiltern had sent to him the previous night, and plans to send it to Sir Robert. The two plan to intercept the letter before it reaches him. However, Sir Robert soon bursts into the room with the letter in hand, believing his wife had written it to him directly. She plays along and he is overjoyed. The two reconcile, and Sir Robert agrees that he must now leave the field of politics due to his disgraceful beginnings. Lord Caversham enters with the news that Sir Robert has been offered the empty cabinet seat. Although tempted, he declines the offer because he believes his wife wants him to retire from public life. However, Lord Goring convinces Lady Chiltern to urge her husband to accept the empty seat, as forcing her husband to abandon his profession will not lead to a happy life or marriage. Finally, with his wife's encouragement, Sir Robert accepts the position. Lord Goring informs the group that he intends to marry Mabel, but Sir Robert refuses permission based on Mrs. Cheveley's presence at Lord Goring's house the previous night. Lady Chiltern admits that it was she that Lord Goring expected, and that the letter Sir Robert believes to be his was written to Lord Goring. Sir Robert understands, forgives his wife for not revealing this to him immediately, and gives permission for the marriage. The play ends with Lady Chiltern proclaiming a new beginning."
The Three Musketeers,"The novel is set in the late 1620s, chiefly in France. It begins with a young man named D'Artagnan who is traveling from his native Gascony to Paris with the hope of starting a military career. He is from a noble family, as opposed to the servant or bourgeois/trade/professional class, but is not wealthy. However he bears a letter of introduction to Monsieur de Treville, captain of the Musketeers, that he believes will secure him a place in the King's Musketeers, an elite guard and military unit. At this time, there is a strong and sometimes violent rivalry between Treville and his musketeers, and the wily Cardinal Richelieu and his own set of guards. Richelieu is an influential adviser to King Louis but is always scheming to build his own power and influence. Shortly after arriving in Paris, D'Artagnan meets three of the Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. After an initially tumultuous meeting, D'Artagnan earns the respect of the musketeers, and the four men become close friends. Through a connection via the wife of his landlord, Constance Bonacieux, D'Artagnan becomes aware of a potential scandal involving Queen Anne and the Duke of Buckingham, an English nobleman. Cardinal Richelieu concocts a plot, using his network of spies and allies, to attempt to embarrass the Queen by revealing her love for Buckingham. With the help of the musketeers, D'Artagnan foils the plot and saves the Queen's reputation. However, D'Artagnan has now been dangerously drawn into a web of schemes and spying, and falls under the spell of Milady de Winter, one of the Cardinal's agents. When he learns that Milady is already in love with one of the Cardinal's allies, the Comte de Wardes, D'Artagnan tricks and betrays her. As a result, she becomes his sworn enemy. D'Artagnan and the other musketeers now have to contend with military service due to a war France is fighting. Because of his love for Queen Anne, Buckingham is planning to send troops and supplies to support France's enemies, and Richelieu is desperate to ensure the French war efforts are not jeopardized. He sends Milady to assassinate Buckingham. Learning of this plot, D'Artagnan and the musketeers act quickly, and are able to get word to Milady's brother, the Lord de Winter, who imprisons her once she arrives in England to carry out her mission. However, Milady seduces her jailer, Felton, and dispatches him to murder Buckingham on her behalf while she returns to England. The assassination is carried out before the allies of the musketeers can stop it, and upon her return to France, Milady also poisons and kills Constance as revenge against D'Artagnan. Once they track her down, the musketeers have Milady killed as punishment for these crimes, and for others spanning many years of her previous life. Once the musketeers reunite with the Cardinal, he acknowledges their bravery and valor, and decides that the antagonism will stop. He even offers one of them a promotion, but since the three older men are hoping to step away from military service soon and take their lives in different directions, they decline. At the end of the novel, D'Artagnan becomes a lieutenant in the Musketeers."
Cyrano de Bergerac,"In Paris, in the year 1640, a brilliant poet and swordsman named Cyrano de Bergerac finds himself deeply in love with his beautiful, intellectual cousin Roxane. Despite Cyrano's brilliance and charisma, a shockingly large nose afflicts his appearance, and he considers himself too ugly even to risk telling Roxane his feelings. One night, Cyrano goes to the playhouse at the Hotel de Bourgogne to make trouble: he has forbidden the actor Montfleury to take the stage for one month, but Montfleury plans to perform in the night's production of La Clorise, with Roxane in the audience. Also in the audience is a young, handsome nobleman named Christian, who confides in his friend Ligniere that he loves Roxane. When Montfleury takes the stage, Cyrano bullies him off it. A group of aristocrats tries to send Cyrano away, but he challenges them all to a duel. He fights Valvert, a Vicomte whom the Comte de Guiche has selected as a husband for Roxane. As he fights, Cyrano improvises a poem about the duel. Then, upon speaking his last line, Cyrano thrusts his sword home. His victory causes a sensation, and Roxane's duenna brings him a message from her mistress, asking him to meet her in the morning. As he agrees, he learns that Ligniere has offended a powerful nobleman with his latest satire and that a hundred men are waiting to ambush him on his way home. Cyrano boldly proclaims that he will see Ligniere safely home and, if necessary, fight all hundred men in the process. The next morning, Cyrano meets Roxane at Ragueneau's pastry shop. He nearly tells her his feelings, but she confides in him that she loves Christian, who will soon join Cyrano's company of guards, the Cadets of Gascoyne. She asks Cyrano to protect Christian, and he agrees. Outside, a crowd has gathered, buzzing with the news about Cyrano's triumphs the night before. Cyrano angrily ignores them, upset by his meeting with Roxane. When the cadets arrive, Christian tries to prove his courage by insulting Cyrano's nose--an act generally considered fatal. Instead of killing Christian, however, Cyrano embraces him and tells him about Roxane's feelings. Delighted at first, Christian then becomes distraught. He considers Roxane an intellectual and sees himself as a simple, unpoetic man. Then Cyrano has a bright idea: Cyrano can write to Roxane -pretending to be Christian. Christian agrees, welcoming the opportunity to reach Roxane's heart. Now, Cyrano can express all his thoughts and feelings secretly. One night soon after, Roxane confides in Cyrano that she thinks Christian is the most ravishing poet in the world. Cyrano's disguised letters have moved her inexpressibly. Christian tells Cyrano he no longer wants Cyrano's help, and then makes a fool of himself trying to speak seductively to Roxane. Roxane storms into her house, confused and angry. Thinking quickly, Cyrano makes Christian stand in front of Roxane's balcony and speak to her while Cyrano stands under the balcony whispering to Christian what to say. Eventually, Cyrano shoves Christian aside and, under cover of darkness, pretends to be Christian, wooing Roxane himself. In the process, he wins a kiss for Christian. Roxane and Christian are secretly married by a Capuchin, but their happiness is short-lived: de Guiche, angry to have lost Roxane, declares that he is sending the Cadets of Gascoyne to the front lines of the war with Spain. At the siege of Arras, the cadets languish and suffer from hunger. Cyrano writes to Roxane every single day, using Christian's name. Moreover, he risks his life each morning by sneaking through the Spanish lines to a place where he can send the letters. De Guiche reveals that the Spaniards will attack within the hour. Suddenly, a coach arrives and Roxane climbs out of it. She has longed to see Christian, again and brings a feast to the soldiers. But Christian has guessed Cyrano's secret feelings for Roxane, and he forces Cyrano to tell her the truth and make her choose between them. On the cusp of revealing his feelings, Cyrano is interrupted by a sudden gunshot that kills Christian. Cyrano cannot tell Roxane the truth. She faints, and de Guiche redeems himself by taking her to safety while Cyrano charges into the battle. Fifteen years later, Roxane lives in a convent, and Cyrano visits her every week. His friend Le Bret informs Roxane that Cyrano is doing very poorly--he has made many powerful enemies, and his life is constantly in danger. Then, Ragueneau rushes in and privately tells Le Bret that Cyrano has been ambushed and hit with a heavy log pushed out of a high window. His health severely jeopardized, Cyrano could die by simply raising his head from his pillow. Le Bret and Ragueneau rush off to their friend's side. No sooner have they gone than Cyrano appears at the convent, walking slowly and with a pained expression on his face, but sounding as cheerful as ever. He gives Roxane a news update. As night falls, Cyrano asks to read Christian's last letter to her. He reads it, and when it is completely dark, he continues to read, as if he knows the letter by heart. Roxane realizes that Cyrano wrote the letters--she has found the soul she was in love with all along. Upset, Ragueneau and Le Bret rush in, proclaiming that Cyrano has killed himself by getting out of bed. Cyrano removes his hat, revealing his heavily bandaged head. Roxane exclaims that she loves him and that he cannot die. But Cyrano draws his sword and engages in one last fight with his ""old enemies""--falsehood, prejudice, and compromise--slashing at the air insensibly. Then he collapses and dies, smiling as Roxane bends over him and kisses his face."
Evelina,"The novel, told in a series of letters by different characters, begins with a discussion of the young Evelina's past. Her mother had died and her father had refused to acknowledge her, so she is being raised by her guardian, the Reverend Mr. Villars. A friend of the family, Lady Howard, asks Mr. Villars to allow the sweet and innocent Evelina to spend time with her family. Mr. Villars gives his consent, and Evelina travels to Howard Grove. She knows the particulars of her background, but uses the name ""Anville"" to escape public scrutiny. Lady Howard's daughter, Mrs. Mirvan, and her granddaughter, Miss Maria Mirvan take Evelina to London to reunite with Mrs. Mirvan's husband, Captain Mirvan, who had returned from seven years at sea. Evelina writes of her adventures in London - her trips to the theater, her promenades and shopping outings, and her first time at an assembly. There, her ignorance and delicacy are made manifest when she declines to dance with a Mr. Lovel, whose foppishness irritates her. She then agrees to dance with another man whose appearance and manner pleases her more - Lord Orville. Being very diffident, she has little to say, but he is charmed nonetheless. She encounters him frequently in London, but is much harassed by another nobleman named Sir Clement Willoughby, who is charming but also immoral, disrespectful, and libidinous. During her stay in London, Evelina's maternal grandmother, a brassy and outspoken Frenchwoman named Madame Duval, finds Evelina and pushes herself into her granddaughter's life. Madame Duval is an obnoxious presence who quarrels constantly with Captain Mirvan, to the point where Evelina's London life grows tiresome. The group returns to Howard Grove for a short time before Madame Duval forces Mr. Villars to allow Evelina to return with her for a month in London away from the Mirvans. She also proposes that they attempt to secure Evelina's inheritance from Sir John Belmont through a lawsuit, but Mr. Villars refuses. Before they leave Howard Grove, Madame Duval is tortured by Captain Mirvan and Sir Clement via a staged robbery and assault on the old woman. Evelina travels to London with her grandmother. The two are in the constant company of the Branghton family, kinsmen of Madame Duval. The young man and his two sisters are boorish, superficial, and unkind. Evelina is ashamed to be in their company in public. At their lodgings, she encounters a depressed young man named Macartney whom she assists by preventing him from committing suicide. She then learns his sad story of a failed romance and an ill-fated duel with his beloved's father; he then discovered that the father was actually his own, meaning he loved his own sister. Moved by his story, Evelina decides to render Macartney any assistance she could. While in London, Sir Clement finds her once again, and pesters her a great deal. Evelina also sees Lord Orville and tries to remain in his good opinion, although she blunders in several ways, and is embarrassed by her family. After her month in London, Evelina returns to stay with Mr. Villars. She is very melancholy there because she had written to Lord Orville apologizing for the Branghtons, and his response was inappropriately sentimental. Her good opinion of him has been ruined, and his impertinence suggests she is not to be respected. Evelina grows ill from the insult, and she is sent to take the waters of Bristol with a widowed neighbor of Mr. Villars, Mrs. Selwyn. In Bristol, Evelina regains her health, and once more enters into fashionable society. She and the satirical, bold Mrs. Selwyn spend time at the house of Mrs. Beaumont, a society matron who was also kinswoman to Lord Orville and his sister, Lady Louisa. Both are soon in Bristol. The latter was engaged to a man named Lord Merton, whose dissipation and lascivious nature makes Evelina extremely uncomfortable. At Mrs. Beaumont's house, Evelina grows closer to Lord Orville, who continues to prove himself a kindhearted and worthy man. He finally declares his love for her, and she reciprocates. She discovers that he knows nothing of the inappropriate letter; Sir Clement had stolen Evelina's letter and written a fake response to try and win her for himself. While there, the situation with Mr. Macartney and Sir John Belmont grows complicated. When Macartney arrives and confesses that Sir John Belmont is his father, Evelina realizes that they are siblings. Mrs. Selwyn visits Sir John to pursue the inheritance issue. She meets with the man, and is shocked when he claims he has raised his daughter. Once he sees Evelina, however, and recognizes his late wife in her face, he pursues and discovers the truth behind what had happened seventeen years before: a nurse to Evelina's dying mother learned Mr. Villars was to raise Evelina himself, and so she brought her own infant daughter to Sir John Belmont to be raised as an heiress. Sir John and Evelina have an emotional reconciliation. The other girl is quietly married off to Mr. Macartney, who is not her brother, and Evelina comes into her inheritance. She then marries Lord Orville, who is now acquainted with her history, and all are happy."
The Portrait of a Lady,"The novel opens with an American son and father, Ralph and Mr. Touchett, and one English man, Lord Warburton, sitting in a garden belonging to a manor called Gardencourt in England. They discuss the great hope of the future, and they believe it lies in the women of their time. They declare that a change is coming. Isabel Archer, the main subject of the novel, then appears on the horizon. Her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, has brought her from America so that she can see the world. Isabel Archer is a young, opinionated woman with many ideas of her own, but little concrete experience or practical knowledge. She is unattached, ambitious and wants to assert her own unique self in life. It is unclear though what she can do in life that could help her realize her ambition. The novel is a representation of the ambitions of a young woman, and her dismal prospects for realizing her own ideas in a restricted, conventional society. Marriage was often the only possibility for a woman to assert her ""success"" in society. It is also an exploration of the possibilities of freedom: can one really be a unique, original and free self, without having to rely upon the generosity of others? Can one assert one's own freedom in any other way, other than negatively, by rejecting other people? What does it mean to be an original? What does it mean to be free? How much does one have to take into account the moral claims of other people on one's own person? Lord Warburton takes an extraordinary step by proposing marriage to Isabel Archer after knowing her for only a short time. He has a great reputation, name, title and plenty of money. This would make him a good husband in the eyes of society. However, Isabel takes the surprising step of turning him down, even though she likes him very much as a person. This makes her very interesting to her cousin Ralph Touchett, who wants to see what a woman who turns down Lord Warburton will do with her life. Ralph and Isabel go with Isabel's American friend, Henrietta Stackpole, to London for a short trip. There, Caspar Goodwood, Isabel's suitor from America, has arrived in order to follow Isabel. He also would like to marry Isabel. He also has a lot of money and has become well established because of his involvement in the cotton industry. Isabel tries to refuse him, but he insists. She tells him to at least give her two years of freedom from him. The group returns to Gardencourt, where Ralph Touchett's father has taken ill and is about to die. There, Isabel meets Madame Merle, a friend of Mrs. Touchett. Madame Merle is a very graceful and talented socialite. Isabel is impressed with her. Meanwhile, Ralph Touchett, who has consumption and expects to die young, tells his father that he does not need all the money his father would leave him in his will. Instead, Ralph insists that his father give half of his money to Isabel Archer upon his death. Ralph tells his father he would like to see what Isabel will do when she is granted the material wealth that will allow her to enact her ideas. Upon Mr. Touchett's death, Mrs. Touchett, Isabel, Ralph, and Madame Merle go to Florence, Italy, where Mrs. Touchett has her own house. Madame Merle introduces Isabel to her friend Gilbert Osmond, an American collector who resides in Florence. He is distinguished by his impeccable taste in art and other commodities. Gilbert Osmond also has a daughter named Pansy. Madame Merle has a plan to get Isabel to marry Gilbert Osmond. Isabel is surprisingly timid in Osmond's presence and is afraid of saying the wrong thing in his presence. Isabel travels around Europe for half a year, and then goes to Greece and the Asia Minor for another half with Madame Merle. She ends her journey in Rome, where Gilbert Osmond comes to visit her. They become engaged in Rome. Isabel then informs her social acquaintances, beginning with Caspar Goodwood, of her intention to marry Gilbert Osmond. None of them approve. Isabel feels that her act of marrying Gilbert Osmond isolates her from her friends. Several years later, Isabel finds herself in a loveless marriage. She gives all the appearance to others of being happy, hosting Thursday evening social gatherings and ""representing"" Gilbert Osmond to the world. But she feels that her husband detests her. He has been unable to change her, to mold her into his image. However they do not ever articulate their dislike for each other; they live civilly, but coolly. Isabel realizes that Osmond is really very shallow, and cares too much about what other people think. He likes to show his superiority to the world by pretending to reject its values in favor of his own ideas, but this is just a show, because he deeply cares about his own image. When Gilbert Osmond's daughter, Pansy, comes of age to be wed, an impetuous young man named Edward Rosier pursues her. He asks for assistance from Madame Merle and Isabel. However, Gilbert Osmond believes that Mr. Rosier is neither rich enough for his daughter, nor well respected enough. Gilbert Osmond and Madame Merle would like Isabel to help them marry Pansy to Lord Warburton. They want Isabel to use Lord Warburton's devotion to Isabel to accomplish this. Isabel ultimately does not want to bring this about, making Osmond believe that she has secretly defied him. Meanwhile, Ralph has taken a turn for the worse. He visits in Rome for a while, and Osmond is displeased that Isabel spends a lot of time with him. Ralph then returns to his home in Gardencourt, where he plans to take his final resting place. Isabel's friends come to Rome to observe whether or not she is really happy in this marriage of which they all disapproved. Isabel begins to suspect, from Madame Merle's overzealous interest in Pansy's marriage, that Madame Merle has meddled in her affairs. She then learns from Osmond's sister that Madame Merle is in fact Pansy's mother, and that Osmond and Madame Merle once had an extramarital affair with each other. Isabel is shocked and horrified to realize that Merle has actually manipulated her into marrying Osmond, and that Osmond has married her for her husband. Isabel's discovery of this fact makes her question whether or not she really was capable of making a free choice all on her own. She realizes that her own life is too mixed up in the affairs of others - in order to be free, she must acknowledge the way her life is entangled in social relations with other people. Isabel openly defies her husband when she returns to Gardencourt to say goodbye to Ralph on his deathbed. Osmond has meanwhile sent his daughter Pansy to a convent, so as to make her forget her love for Edward Rosier. Isabel promises Pansy that she will return. Isabel learns from Madame Merle that Ralph was the one who made her a rich woman. Upon his deathbed, Ralph confesses to having ruined Isabel by giving her so much money and making her a target for fortune hunters. Isabel and Ralph though share an intimate moment and stress the importance of one another for each other's lives. The novel concludes with Caspar Goodwood's arrival at Gardencourt, and his suggestion to Isabel that they begin a love affair, since Isabel is so unhappy in her marriage. She refuses and runs away, to return to her husband and Pansy in Rome. This novel explores the nature of human freedom, moral choice, and conventional social relations. What does it mean to be free? How should the needs of others factor into our lives? What does it mean to be deceptive to others? It also explores the significance of the aesthetic approach to objects. Aesthetics is the philosophical exploration of beauty: what makes something beautiful? And what makes something a work of art? Henry James is considering how we might use the aesthetic approach in our relationships to other people. Is it wrong to see another person as a work of art? What can we learn from reading the story of a person as if it were a ""portrait"" of a lady?"
The Prince,"The Prince begins with an address to Lorenzo de Medici, in which Machiavelli explains that he is seeking favor with the prince by offering him some of his knowledge. He then proceeds to classify the various kinds of states: republics, hereditary princedoms, brand-new princedoms, and mixed principalities. New states are his primary focus, for those are the hardest to deal with. A conquered state whose original prince was its sole ruler is difficult to conquer, but easy to maintain; a conquered state in which the prince shared power with the barons is easy to conquer, but difficult to maintain. When possible, a prince should strive to rise to power on his own merits and with his own arms. Relying on friends, good luck, or other people's arms may make the rise easier, but holding onto his newfound power will prove a difficult task. Machiavelli devotes almost an entire chapter to Cesare Borgia, who rose to prominence largely through connections and his father's help, but was crafty enough to carve out his own niche - though he wound up failing in the end. Princes who rise to the throne through crime are another matter altogether: Machiavelli condemns them as wicked, and yet his words betray his admiration for their cleverness. Cruelty, when well-used, can be justified. According to Machiavelli, reliance on mercenaries and auxiliaries for troops is a grave mistake. A prince must lay strong foundations - good laws and good arms - and if the latter is lacking, the former is rendered irrelevant. A state needs both to survive. Mercenaries are disloyal and divided; foreign auxiliaries come already united under another master, and so are in a way even more dangerous. The prince himself should be a student of war and an avid reader of military history. Reputation is another important element to consider. The front princes put on to appeal to the populace is often a lie, as Machiavelli notes; the better the liar, the better the prince. That said, giving out money when it is fiscally irresponsible, just to appear generous, is a mistake; displaying excessive mercy in order to garner affection can prove fatal. Better safe than sorry; better to be feared than to be loved. Machiavelli closes The Prince with a meditation on luck and its role in human affairs, and a call to unite Italy. He addresses much of this last argument to Lorenzo de Medici, thereby imposing some semblance of symmetry on his book's structure and honing his theoretical musings into a direct exhortation."
The Red and the Black,"Julien Sorel is just a poor carpenter's son. His love of reading has given him all kinds of grand ideas about becoming a great man. The only problem is that Julien is living in early 19th-century France following the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte. The country is basically run by an unquestioned king and a bunch of superficial elites who wouldn't know honor if it slapped them in the face. Julien catches a break when he's hired to be a tutor for the children of the wealthy Monsieur de Renal, mayor of Verrieres. Julien has an affair with de Renal's wife and has to leave town to go to priest's school to avoid the scandal. While at the seminary, he gets another new job as a personal secretary for the Marquis de La Mole, one of the most influential men in Paris. Julien goes to live with the Marquis, but is quickly disillusioned by how superficial and boring life in the upper-class parts of Paris can be. No one says anything with any conviction and the world is just filled with a bunch of snarky social climbers. Julien forms a romantic relationship with the Marquis' beautiful daughter Mathilde. The problem is that both he and Mathilde only want what they can't have, and this creates a certain love-hate dance between them. Acting on the advice of a Russian friend, Julien beats Mathilde at her own love games and secures her affection. She also reveals to him that she's pregnant with his child. The two decide to get married. Mathilde's dad is furious that Mathilde wants to marry a peasant, but he eventually agrees and gives Julien everything he'll need to live as a wealthy man. Unfortunately, the Marquis withdraws his support for the wedding when he receives a letter from Julien's old flame, Madame de Renal. Madame's letter says that Julien is a dastardly opportunist who only seduced Mathilde to climb the social ladder. After losing his father-in-law's trust and respect, Julien travels back to his hometown of Verrieres and shoots Madame de Renal. She lives, but he's imprisoned and sentenced to death anyway. Julien makes sure to use his last days in the limelight to criticize France and all of its hypocrisy. He is then beheaded and everyone in France goes back to their insincere, superficial lives."
The Consolation of Philosophy,"The Consolation of Philosophy is a short work of literature, written in the form of a prosimetrical apocalyptic dialogue . It contains five Books, which are written in a combination of prose and verse. The dialogue is between Ancius Boethius, a prominent and learned official of the Roman Empire, and the person of Philosophy. The work opens with a scene between Boethius and the Muses of Poetry, who are attending him in his sorrow while he writes poetry of his woe. They are interrupted by the entrance of a strange and otherwordly-looking lady, Lady Philosophy. She explains that she has come to him in his hour of need, for he suffers from the sickness of being far too attached to material and earthly things. While Boethius protests that he is the victim of injustice, Lady Philosophy begins his ""cure"" by showing him the error of his ways. She begins by explaining that the vagaries of Fortune visit everyone, and he is by no means the worst of her victims. Even though he is imprisoned and due for execution, he has still the faculties of his mind and soul to comfort him. She explains that the gifts of Fortune were never his at all, but merely lent to him and taken away as easily as they were given. Health, wealth, honor, and power are things that never truly belong to any human being, and are visited on them by the wheel of fortune and quickly snatched away. Therefore it is unwise to become attached to any temporal thing. The ""cure"" continues as Boethius begins to see the logic of Philosophy's argument. They continue their dialogue and discuss the nature of earthly goods, and how they are not the path to true happiness. The thing the temporal world considers good, says Philosophy, are only inferior decorations on the ultimate earthly good, the soul and the intellectual capacity of humanity. Boethius offers a partial proof for God, a negative one based on the inadequacy of earthly attainments to satisfy the desire for perfect happiness . Therefore, since all humanity desires it, the standard for perfect happiness must exist, and that self-sufficient, powerful, and revered being who has attained perfect happiness is God. Evil has no substance, according to Philosophy, because it cannot participate in the ultimate pursuit of mankind: the supreme good. Therefore people who inflict their wickedness on the good are not truly powerful, since they have no capacity to stop the good people's attainment of the one thing that matters. God orders the world through Providence, and the order of things that happen on earth is called Fate. Though people on earth cannot understand the ways of Providence, they must nevertheless accept whatever Fate sends, for all fortune, good or bad, is good. Bad fortune can instruct the recipient in the ways of virtue, and, often is better for the soul. God does not interfere with free will, Philosophy concludes. Though God knows all things past and present, this knowledge doesn't preclude the freedom of choice of human beings. God's knowledge is not like our knowledge, and doesn't happen over a period of time. God had one act of knowing the world, and in that act knew all things, including all the free choices of all the people throughout the entire history of the world. Finally, Boethius, through this long conversation with Philosophy, has been comforted. Philosophy leaves him with the advice to cultivate virtue, for the Heavenly Judge sees all things."
The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Dorian Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton at the studio of Basil Hallward, who is using Dorian as a model for his latest painting. Lord Henry tells Dorian about his epicurean views on life, and convinces him of the value of beauty above all other things. The young and impressionable Dorian is greatly moved by Lord Henry's words. When Basil shows them the newly completed painting, Dorian is flooded with awe at the sight of his own image, and is overwhelmed by his fear that his youth and beauty will fade. He becomes jealous that the picture will be beautiful forever while he is destined to wither and age. He passionately wishes that it could be the other way around. Lord Henry is fascinated with Dorian's innocence as much as Dorian is impressed by Henry's cynically sensual outlook on life. They become fast friends, to Basil's dismay. He fears that Henry will be a corrupting influence on the young, innocent Dorian, whom he adores. Dorian and Lord Henry become fast friends, often dining together and attending the same social functions. Henry's influence has a profound effect on the young man, who soon adopts Henry's views as his own, abandoning ethical restraints and seeing life in terms of pleasure and sensuality. Dorian falls in love with the beautiful Sibyl Vane, a poor but talented young Shakespearean actress. They are engaged to be married until Dorian brings Henry and Basil to a performance, where her acting is uncharacteristically - and inexplicably - terrible. Dorian confronts Sibyl backstage, and she tells him that since she is now truly in love, she no longer believes in acting. Disgusted and offended, Dorian breaks off their engagement and leaves her sobbing on the floor. When he returns home, he discovers that the figure in his portrait now bears a slightly different, more contemptuous facial expression. Dorian awakens late the next day feeling guilty for his treatment of Sibyl, and writes an impassioned love letter begging her forgiveness. Soon, however, Lord Henry arrives, and informs Dorian that Sibyl committed suicide last night. Dorian is shocked and wracked with guilt, but Henry convinces him to view the event artistically, saying that the superb melodrama of her death is a thing to be admired. Succumbing to the older man's suggestion, Dorian decides that he need not feel guilty, especially since his enchanted portrait will now bear his guilt for him. The picture will serve as his conscience, allowing him to live freely. When Basil visits Dorian to console him, he is appalled at his friend's apathy towards Sibyl's death. Dorian is unapologetic and annoyed by Basil's adulation of him. Paranoid that someone might discover the secret of the painting, and therefore the true nature of his soul, Dorian hides the image in his attic. Over the next several years, Dorian's face remains young and innocent, despite his many selfish affairs and scandals. He is an extremely popular socialite, admired for his fine taste and revered as a fashionable trend-setter. The picture, however, continues to age, and grows more unattractive with each foul deed. Dorian cannot keep himself from looking at the picture periodically, but he is appalled by it, and is only truly happy when he manages to forget its existence. He immerses himself in various obsessions, studying mysticism, jewelry, music, and ancient tapestries. These interests, however, are all merely distractions that allow him to forget the hideousness of his true soul. One night, Basil visits Dorian to confront him about all of the terrible rumors he has heard. The painter wants to believe that his friend is stll a good person. Dorian decides to show him the portrait so that he can see the true degradation of his soul, but when Basil sees it he is horrified, and urges his friend to repent for his sins. Basil's reaction enrages Dorian, and he murders the artist with a knife. To dispose of the body, he blackmails an estranged acquaintance, Alan Campbell, a chemist who is able to burn the body in the attic's fireplace. Alan has already been driven into isolation by Dorian's corrupting influence, and this action eventually compels him to commit suicide. Not long after, Dorian visits an opium den and is attacked by James Vane, Sibyl's brother, who has sworn revenge on the man that drove his sister to suicide. 18 years have passed since the event, however, yet Dorian still looks like a 20-year-old youth. James thinks that he is mistaken, and Dorian escapes before his would-be murderer learns the truth. Over the next several days Dorian lives in fear, sure that James is searching for him. While hunting one day, Dorian's friend Geoffrey accidentally shoots a man hiding on Dorian's property. This stranger is revealed to be James Vane. Dorian is overcome with relief, but cannot escape the fact that four deaths now weigh on his conscience. Deciding to change his life for the better, Dorian commits a good deed by refusing to corrupt a young girl who has fallen in love with him. He checks the portrait, hoping to find that it has changed for the better, but when he realizes that the only thing that has changed is the new, hypocritical smirk on the wrinkled face, he realizes that even his effort to save his soul was driven by vanity. In a fit of despair, he decides to destroy the picture with the same knife that he used to kill Basil, its creator. Downstairs, Dorian's servants hear a shriek, and rush upstairs to find their master dead on the floor, the knife plunged into his own chest. Dorian's youthful countenance is gone, and his servants are only able to recognize him by the jewelry on his fingers."
Lord Jim,"Jim, the well-loved son of an English parson, goes to sea to make a name for himself. Just how he is to become ""Tuan Jim"" or ""Lord Jim,"" however, remains to be told. With his youthful, romantic aspirations for the sea, he is physically powerful; he has ""Ability in the abstract."" He roams the Asian south seas as a water-clerk, moving from place to place, always trying to outrun, it seems, a particular fact of his past. The story then cuts to an early incident where Jim lost an opportunity to prove his mettle: he ""leapt"" too late, missing his chance. Then, after a long injury and hospital stay, instead of deciding to return to England, Jim accepts the position of chief mate of the Patna, an old local steamship carrying 800 Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. There are five white men on board, as crew, and the voyage is led by a fat, crazy, German captain. One night, as the ship sails quietly through the Arabian sea, the crew, including Jim, feels a strange vibration disturb the underbelly of the ship. The reader is given no reason for the vibration and the eventual conclusion of the incident. Suddenly, we encounter Jim speaking at the official Inquiry, which is attempting to gather facts about the event. In time, the story grows clear, pieced together for the reader. Believing that the steamship was on the verge of sinking at any moment, and fearful of a panic, the crew of the Patna loosed a lifeboat for themselves. Though it had been only a trick of the eyes, they believed that when the light on the ship had gone out, the ship had sunk like iron to the floor of the sea. The crew had devised a story: they told their rescuers that the ship sank beneath their very feet and that they alone were able to launch a single lifeboat in time. Ironically, however, we learn that the steamship never actually sank. Iron proved to be a hardy metal. Upon its discovery by a French gunboat, the Patna is brought safely to an English port. The story becomes notorious throughout the region. Marlow, a British captain, attends the Inquiry and is struck by some quality of Jim's character. Thus he is now telling the story of Jim. A party is gathered around him on a verandah, listening, as he explains what happened next. When the judgment was meted out and Jim's sea certificates were effectively canceled, Marlow, having befriended the poor youth, offered him help. Thus Jim is sent to live with an old friend of Marlow's with no family, the owner of a rice mill. But when another crew member of the Patna coincidentally turns out to be the manager of the machinery at the very same mill, Jim leaves, not wanting to be near the memory of the event. He instead works as a runner of boats and then as a water-clerk, getting in a barroom brawl with a man who makes a derogatory comment regarding the Patna. Driven by intense shame and guilt with regard to the incident, Marlow worries, what is the fate of such a man? He consults his good friend Stein, a successful merchant with a romantic and tragic life history. Stein, also a collector of fragile, beautiful butterflies, dreams and leads a solitary life. Both he and Marlow share a thoughtful conversation about Jim, where Stein concludes: ""He is a romantic."" This idea marks a turn in the novel. Stein offers Jim the chance that Stein himself had been given when he was a youth: the chance to make the dreams real. The practical solution is thus to send Jim to Stein's trade post in Patusan, a remote settlement on the island of Borneo . There, Jim is to manage the post. Excited by the opportunity and the chance for a ""clean slate,"" a chance to be free of the past, Jim carries a silver ring around his neck. The ring was a token of friendship between Stein and Doramin, a chief native trader in Patusan, serving as a sign of good will and trust. In Patusan, Jim falls into the depths of a romantically archetypal setting: political intrigues abound, and factional fighting over trade is becoming increasingly bitter. Jim is immediately taken prisoner by the Rajah, though after three days he leaps over the wall--and then the creek--into the beginning of his charmed life. He leads the defeat of Doramin's key opponent for trade, driving him out of the area completely, which establishes a sense of peaceful stalemate with the frightened Rajah. Jim thus achieves power, status, and a good name. He also becomes the best friend of Doramin's only son, Dain Waris. Marlow, who visits him once in Patusan, is struck by some change of essence in Jim. There is now a love story, too. Jim, admits to Marlow that he loves a woman, ""Jewel."" Jewel's mother, an educated Dutch-Malay woman, had been married to Cornelius, the prior manager of Stein's trade post, although Cornelius had proven very bad for business, and Jewel's mother had died as well. Jewel, the natural daughter of a different, unknown man, is oppressed and hounded by Cornelius. Jim protects her, feeling deep sympathy for her position. She becomes his link to the insights needed to manage among Patusan affairs and, in the end, the entire situation comes to echo much of Stein's own romantic history. Unstable elements in this picture remain clear. As Marlow's visit draws to a close, Jewel confronts him and asks whether there is anything in Jim's past that might take him away from her--that would cause him to leave Patusan. Marlow assures her that there is nothing and that Jim will never leave. But there is a sense of overwhelming dread in the girl's voice and manner; she thus foreshadows the tragic events to come. Cornelius's hatred for Jim, as well as the Rajah's fear for his own power, both contribute to the uncertain future. But this part of the tale, which Marlow has been telling his audience, now comes to a close. The audience rises. There is no comment. The story is incomplete. The tale resumes later in time in the written story, along with a letter and some fragments including details from Jim's own writing. All of these enclosures are sent to a single ""privileged man"" or ""privileged reader,"" the one person who had been listening to Marlow and who had expressed an interest in Jim's fate. Marlow explains to this anonymous man that he had gone to Stein's house and found Jim's servant, and then Jewel. Hoping that Jim was also present, he instead learned that the story ended. Now cutting to another source, Marlow also explains that, on a tip, he met Brown, a man of sordid reputation, in Bangkok. Brown explained that he had stolen a schooner. Brown's band of men wanted to cross the Indian Ocean, but they realized they were running out of both food and water. Landing in Patusan in the hope of replenishing their supplies, Brown and his men were greeted by gunfire. The attack was led by Dain Waris . One of the Rajah's men took the opportunity to double-deal and to encourage Brown and his men to kill Jim in order to defeat Doramin's settlement. Cornelius encouraged him likewise. Upon Jim's return, he and Brown have an exchange that strikes Jim in his weak spot. Recognizing that this man Brown is what he himself could have become, had Fortune given him the right opportunity, Jim gives Brown the chance to escape safely. In the end, however, with Cornelius's help, Brown and his men sneak up on Dain Waris and his men and open fire, killing Dain Waris, who just received news from Jim that all had been settled and things were stable. Jim had even sent the ring along as a sign of trust. Now, when Doramin looks upon his son's dead body and sees the silver ring on his forefinger, Doramin throws an emotional rage. Jim, hearing the news, ignores Jewel's pleas and walks resolutely to meet justice in the form of Doramin. Doramin shoots him in the chest, killing Jim. But Jim has now atoned for his failures. The tale ends with Marlow offering his reader a last view of Stein, growing old, and a muted Jewel."
Far from the Madding Crowd,"The novel opens with a chance encounter between Gabriel Oak and Bathsheba Everdene just outside the town of Casterbridge. Gabriel comes from humble origins as a shepherd, but has recently leased his own farm and seems to have good economic prospects. He is immediately struck by Bathsheba's beauty, although he quickly becomes aware that she is proud and headstrong. Although Bathsheba has been well-educated, she has fallen on hard times and is now required to take a very hands-on role helping her aunt to take care of her farm. The close proximity of their farms leads to a series of encounters between the two, including an incident in which Bathsheba saves Gabriel's life. After only knowing her for a short time, Gabriel proposes to Bathsheba and is surprised when she turns him down, explaining that she does not love him and is reluctant to give up her independence. Shortly after this conversation, Bathsheba moves away to the town of Weatherbury. A short time later, Gabriel experiences a dramatic reversal of fortune when he loses the majority of his sheep in a disastrous accident. He loses all of his money and has to give up his farm and seek work in whatever capacity he can find. While he is looking for work near the town of Weatherbury, he happens to come across a fire that is threatening to destroy a large amount of valuable crops. Gabriel takes charge of the situation and helps to get the fire under control, only to learn later that the owner of the farm is Bathsheba. She has inherited it from her uncle, and has taken the unusual step of managing it herself, even though this was uncommon for a woman at the time. She hires Gabriel to work as a shepherd. Bathsheba attracts a great deal of attention as an attractive, single, and prosperous woman with unconventional ideas, but she is dismayed to notice that William Boldwood, a successful middle-aged farmer, does not seem curious about her. On a whim, Bathsheba sends him a Valentine's Day card as a prank; when she does so, she unwittingly sets the stage for Boldwood, who is lonely and shy, to fall deeply in love with her. Boldwood proposes to Bathsheba a short time later, leaving her surprised and uncomfortable. She turns down the offer but is not entirely sure how to proceed in the future, since she knows some aspects of the marriage would be advantageous. Boldwood's courtship leads to disagreement between Gabriel and Bathsheba, to the point where she initially dismisses him from his job, but quickly hires him back when he saves many of her sheep after they eat poisonous plants and become ill. Boldwood proposes to Bathsheba a second time and although she does not accept, she gives him reason to be hopeful that she will. That same night, however, Bathsheba meets the handsome and charismatic Sergeant Troy, who quickly stirs her emotions. Knowing that Bathsheba is attracted to Troy, whom he is suspicious of, Gabriel encourages her to choose to marry Boldwood instead. Nonetheless, Bathsheba's growing feelings for Troy lead her to tell Boldwood she can never marry him. Boldwood is angry and jealous, and even threatens violence against Troy, especially since Troy has a bad reputation as a womanizer. Bathsheba is nervous about what will happen when Troy, who is currently away in Bath, returns and she decides to go to Bath herself to end the relationship and tell him not to come back. However, when Troy and Bathsheba return from Bath, they are married, a fact which Troy reveals to Boldwood only after playing a cruel trick on him and deceiving Boldwood into offering to pay Troy to marry the woman he loves. Both Boldwood and Gabriel are deeply upset by this reckless decision. Their worries seem well-founded, since Troy quickly proves to be lazy and unmotivated to help with running the farm. Gabriel narrowly averts disaster when a severe thunderstorm takes place on the night of the harvest celebrations and he takes the initiative to protect the uncovered crops since everyone else at the farm has gotten too drunk to help out. With Troy showing no signs of wanting to change his behavior, and spending money recklessly, the relationship between him and Bathsheba becomes worse and worse. In October, about 9 months after the beginning of the novel, Troy and Bathsheba meet a young woman walking on the road. She seems to be ill and impoverished, and the sight of her triggers strange behavior from Troy, which he refuses to explain to his wife. Troy is determined to hide the identity of the woman: Fanny Robbins, who was formerly a servant at the Everdene farm. She and Troy had an affair the previous winter while he was stationed with his troops in Melchester, and Fanny ran away believing she and Troy were going to elope. However, he abandoned her and she found herself pregnant. Now close to giving birth, she is trying to make her way to a local poorhouse. Troy arranges to meet her in a few days time, hoping to give her money and help her. However, after making an agonizing journey to the poorhouse, Fanny and her baby both die during childbirth. When Bathsheba learns of the death of her former servant, although not the cause, she sends for the body to be brought back to Weatherbury and buried there. Meanwhile, Troy sets out to meet Fanny, unaware of her death. Gabriel arranges for the fact that Fanny died giving birth to be hidden from Bathsheba, but the combination of rumors and her husband's suspicious behavior lead her to open the coffin and find the corpses of both Fanny and the infant inside. Bathsheba also realizes that Troy must be the father of Fanny's child, and when he comes home, the two of them have a heated argument. Bathsheba flees from the house and does not return until the coffin has been taken away. By that time, Troy has also left the house and he is seen leaving town a short time later. Troy makes his way to the seashore, where he gets caught up in a strong tide while taking a swim. He is rescued by some sailors and impulsively decides to join them on their voyage to America. As a result of this sudden disappearance, Troy is presumed to have drowned, and Bathsheba is declared a widow. This train of events leads Boldwood to hope that he will be able to marry her eventually, although Bathsheba insists that because Troy's death was only established circumstantially, she wants to wait a full 7 years after his death. Time passes, and at the end of the summer, almost a year after his vanishing, Troy secretly returns to Weatherbury. He has gotten tried of living in poverty and is considering reuniting with his wife, although he does not immediately reveal his identity or presence. Meanwhile, Boldwood has mentioned his hopes of marriage to Bathsheba and she has agreed to tell him at Christmas whether or not she will begin the 6-year engagement. Troy has learned that Bathsheba is considering remarrying, and on Christmas Eve, he makes a surprise appearance at the lavish party Boldwood is throwing. He tries to reclaim Bathsheba as his wife, but Boldwood flies into a rage and shoots and kills him. Boldwood is initially sentenced to death for this crime, but is eventually found to be insane and sentenced to life in prison. Bathsheba is traumatized by these events but slowly recovers, becoming more and more dependent on Gabriel to help her run the farm. She is shocked and unhappy to learn that he plans to leave England and move to America. This news leads Bathsheba to reflect on how valuable and loyal Gabriel has been. One night, she goes to his cottage to ask him why he is determined to leave, and as the two talk, it becomes clear that they both love each other, but have each been confused about the feelings of the other. A short time later, Gabriel and Bathsheba finally marry with much rejoicing from the local people and farm workers."
Far From the Madding Crowd,"So there's this guy named Gabriel Oak and he sounds like a pretty solid dude . One day, he sees a proud and beautiful young woman named Bathsheba and decides he wants to marry her. The problem is that Bathsheba thinks she's too good for him and turns him down. Worse yet, Oak loses his livelihood when one of his dogs chases all his sheep off a cliff. Things aren't looking great for the guy. After wandering the countryside looking for a job, Oak arrives in a town called Weatherbury and gets himself a job as a shepherd. And who should happen to be his new boss but his old flame Bathsheba, who has inherited the farm after her uncle's recent death. Uh oh. Meanwhile, a wealthy old farmer in the area named Boldwood decides that he'd like to marry Bathsheba, too. And she even gives Boldwood a half-promise to say yes, even though she doesn't love him. Things look like they might wrap up nicely at this point. But nope. Not so fast. Enter a cocky, handsome young man named Sergeant Troy. He rolls into Weatherbury and sweeps Bathsheba off her feet. The two of them get married quickly, which breaks the hearts of both Boldwood and Gabriel Oak. As you might expect, Troy is a total jerk to Bathsheba after they're married. What's even worse, though, is that Troy used to be engaged to one of Bathsheba's servants--Fanny Robin--and he has left her to die in the streets. When Bathsheba finds this out, her heart totally breaks. It's around this time that Troy realizes he's a bad dude, so he just does everyone a favor by faking his death and disappearing for a year. When life turns out to be really hard without his wife's money, though, he comes skulking back to Weatherbury to claim his fortune. During his absence, Boldwood has pestered Bathsheba into marrying him. On the night Boldwood hopes to announce the engagement, though, Troy shows up to steal Bathsheba away for a second time. Boldwood snaps and blows the dude away with a shotgun. Shortly afterwards, Boldwood turns himself in at a nearby police station. He's sentenced to be executed, but gets pardoned at the last minute because everyone thinks he's insane. Meanwhile, Gabriel Oak tells Bathsheba that he'll be leaving for America soon. She begs him to stay, and he agrees to... if the two of them can get married. She agrees and they get married shortly after. Now if Bathsheba had just agreed to marry Gabriel Oak the first time he asked, things would have been a lot tidier. Troy wouldn't have been blown to smithereens and Boldwood would still be hanging around. Oh, well. It was way more dramatic and juicy this way, and at least there's a happy ending?"

The White Devil,"The White Devil opens with Lodovico, a murderous Italian count, being informed by his two friends Gasparo and Antonelli of his banishment from Rome. Lodovico is enraged, but he agrees to leave, and gives his friends money to work towards securing his pardon. Elsewhere, the Duke of Brachiano visits the house of Camillo with the intention of seducing his beautiful wife, Vittoria Corombona. Aided by her social-climbing brother Flamineo and her Moor servant Zanche, Vittoria allows Brachiano to secretly visit her. He gives her a jewel, and she tells him of a dream she had wherein her husband and his wife tried to kill her. Brachiano promises to protect her. Suddenly, Vittoria's mother, Cornelia, steps out of the shadows. She criticizes Brachiano's and Vittoria's affair, cursing them and her family. In Act 2, Francisco de Medici, the Duke of Florence, welcomes home his sister and Brachiano's wife, Isabella. Despite her husband's infidelities, Isabella pleads with Francisco to be kind to Brachiano. She leaves, and Brachiano enters. Francisco recruits Cardinal Monticelso to chastise Brachiano for his infidelities. Threats of war between Brachiano and Francisco are made. After Giovanni, Isabella and Brachiano's son, comes on stage, Francisco and Brachiano seem to reconcile, and their threatening talk of war subside. Monticelso and Francisco leave, and Isabella approaches Brachiano. He quarrels with her despite her placating nature, and he cruelly divorces her. Isabella is unhappy, but she offers to take responsibility for instigating the divorce since she has justifiable cause , and he doesn't. Monticelso and Francisco re-enter to find Isabella yelling at Brachiano for his involvement with Vittoria, and for divorcing him. They scold her for being a jealous woman, and she leaves. Meanwhile, Doctor Julio plots with Flamineo and Brachiano on how to best murder Isabella and Camillo. Monticelso and Francisco address the newly arrived Camillo, who is also Monticelso's nephew. They send him off to fight pirates so that they may secretly observe Brachiano's and Vittoria's behavior while he is away. Later, Brachiano and a conjurer meet in the middle of the night. Brachiano asks him to reveal the particulars of the two planned murders, and the conjurer draws up silent shows of the simultaneous events. In Padua, Doctor Julio and his assistant Christophero poison the lips of a painting of Brachiano. During her nightly devotions, Isabella kisses the lips, and quickly dies. Meanwhile, at Camillo's house, a night of drinking and carousing leads Camillo and Flamineo to compete in vaulting. While all the other revelers are out of the room, Flamineo grabs Camillo and breaks his neck, making his death look like a vaulting accident. Pleased with the visions, Brachiano leaves. Monticelso and Francisco suspect foul play in Camillo's death, and they put Vittoria on trial for it. Although they lack evidence that she committed the murders, they plan to ruin her character and secure conviction that way. Flamineo and Marcello argue over Flamineo's illicit actions, while various ambassadors arrive to act as judges in the trial. Brachiano unexpectedly shows up to the trial, and Vittoria dismisses her lawyer because he refuses to speak plainly. Monticelso then takes on the role of both prosecutor and judge, and repeatedly calls Vittoria a whore. Vittoria indignantly defends herself, and her bravery wins over the admiration of the ambassadors. Despite this, Monticelso sentences her to a ""house of convertites,"" a place for penitent whores. Vittoria rages against Monticelso, crying as she is taken away that he has raped Justice. After the trial, Brachiano re-enters and murmurs a few mysterious words to Francisco. Giovanni then clarifies the mystery: Isabella is dead. Flamineo is upset with the trial's verdict, and accuses Monticelso of being corrupt. Lodovico enters, and the two murderers exchange insults before Antonelli reveals that Lodovico's banishment has been lifted. Flamineo hits Lodovico for calling Vittoria a whore, and everyone disperses. Secretly seeking revenge for his sister's death, Francisco borrows Monticelso's ""black book"" of criminals, looking for a hitman. Isabella's ghost appears to him, but he dismisses it, thinking it simply a symptom of his melancholy. He writes a fake love letter to Vittoria in order to enrage Brachiano. Later, while Flamineo is talking with the matron of the house of convertites, Francisco's servant delivers the love letter. When Brachiano reads it, he becomes wildly jealous of Vittoria, and calls her a whore. Although Vittoria denies any relationship with Francisco, Brachiano breaks off his relationship with her. When he sees her sobbing, however, he has a change of heart, believes her, and resolves to break her out of her prison. Meanwhile, the papal election is underway, and Lodovico stands guard outside of the conclave to prevent bribery. Soon, the Cardinal of Arragon announces the new Pope: Cardinal Monticelso. During the pageantry, a servant informs Francisco that Vittoria, Brachiano, Flamineo, and Giovanni have fled the city. Outwardly outraged, Francisco inwardly admits that this has been his plan all along. He gets Monticelso to excommunicate Brachiano and Vittoria, and hires Lodovico to murder them. After Francisco leaves, Monticelso asks Lodovico why Francisco pushed for his pardon. Lodovico reveals the murder plan, which Monticelso outwardly disapproves of but secretly facilitates through money sent to Lodovico. Lodovico leaves on his mission, encouraged by the support of both Francisco and the new Pope. Meanwhile, Vittoria and Brachiano have married and are now holding court in Padua. Mulinassar, a mysterious Moor, has recently arrived at their court, along with two Capuchin monks. Brachiano welcomes them, but when he leaves the stage, the men reveal their true identities. Francisco has disguised himself as a Moor, and Lodovico and Gasparo are accompanying him. Flamineo speaks with Hortensio, a member of Brachiano's court, and reveals that he is sleeping with Zanche, Vittoria's Moor servant. Zanche has a brief fight with Flamineo, during which Cornelia flies in and attacks her. Marcello and Flamineo fight over Flamineo's improper relationship with Zanche, and in response to Marcello's criticism, Flamineo kills him. Brachiano is forced to try Flamineo for murder. While they talk, Lodovico poisons the mouthpiece of Brachiano's helmet. Soon after, during the celebratory wedding games, Brachiano realizes that he has been poisoned. Gasparo and Lodovico, disguised as monks, are left alone to preside over his last rites, but they instead curse and strangle him. Zanche, now in love with the supposed Moor Mulinassar , admits to him how Isabella and Camillo died, as well as that she and Vittoria are running away that night. Now in charge, Giovanni banishes Flamineo from the court. While leaving, Flamineo encounters his brother's funeral, and his distracted mother. After witnessing Brachiano's ghost, Flamineo decides to kill his sister in order to set everything right. Elsewhere, Francisco and Lodovico meet, and Lodovico tells Francisco to leave the court so that he is not implicated in the murders. Hortensio overhears their conversation, and alerts Giovanni and the armies. Flamineo finds Vittoria and Zanche, and demands money. He reveals that Brachiano made him promise to kill Vittoria if he ever died. The women agree to a three-way suicide pact, with Flamineo dying first. They break their promise, however, and shoot only him. Flamineo is outraged, and reveals that the gun was not loaded with bullets. He springs up to kill them, but Lodovico, Gasparo, Carlo and Pedro barge in. The men stab Flamineo, Vittoria, and Zanche to death. However, Giovanni and his guards storm on stage at the moment and capture the four murderers."
Uncle Vanya,"At the opening of Act I, it is a cloudy autumn day on a Russian country estate. In the garden, the old nurse Marina stands at the samovar and offers Doctor Astrov something to eat, but he refuses. He complains about the difficulty of his job. Telegin, an impoverished local landowner, sits with them. Voynitsky, known as Vanya, comes out of the house and joins them. He is almost fifty and is weary and irritable. He complains about his brother-in-law, Serebryakov , Serebryakov's young second wife, Helen, and about how their visit has turned the place upside down. Serebryakov, Helen, and Serebryakov's daughter, Sonya, join them for a moment. After they depart, Vanya sighs about Helen's beauty and then complains about how he has toiled his whole life on this estate for the professor and it has come to naught. After Vanya's sister's death, he and Sonya worked here so the professor could continue his studies and his writings, but Vanya has come to see that work as foolish and irrelevant. When Astrov suggests that Vanya is jealous, Vanya laughs that he obviously is, especially as the old, gout-and-rheumatism-ridden man seems to attract beautiful women. Helen ventures outside and tells Astrov his services are not needed for her husband. Mrs. Voynitsky, Vanya's mother and Sonya's grandmother, tells them about a new pamphlet written by a friend in Kharkov. When Vanya sneers that all they do is read pamphlets, she becomes distressed and claims he hates her. Vanya merely says he is old, tired, and frustrated. A laborer arrives and tells Astrov he is wanted at the factory; the doctor bitterly departs, but not before they all discuss how he is very interested in forestry work. Sonya speaks up cheerfully about how Astrov is trying to save the old forest from destruction because forests make people happier. Astrov speaks of how Russians have torn down the forests and destroyed the wildlife: they no longer create, but rather destroy. After Sonya walks Astrov out, Vanya tries to seduce Helen, but she pushes him away. She muses about how Sonya clearly seems to love the doctor but he does not love her back. Helen sighs that she is simply bored and life is too much for her. In Act II, Serebryakov complains to Helen of how he is old and no one respects him. His querulous behavior only annoys Helen, who begs him to stop it. Serebryakov ignores her and bemoans how his life of scholarship seems to be nothing now. Sonya joins them and tells them Serebryakov must see Astrov now; she wants her father to stop behaving like a child. The elderly nurse Marina comforts Serebryakov and leads him out. Helen tells Vanya, who entered the room, that her husband wearies her. Vanya can only lament that everything is over for him and his life was wasted on trivial things. Helen is annoyed and moves to leave, but he bars her way. She accuses him of being drunk, and he admits to it. After Helen sweeps out of the room, Vanya ruminates on what a fool he was not to fall in love with her when she was younger; he once admired the professor, but now he does not. When Astrov returns, he mocks Vanya for having feelings for Helen, but Vanya will not admit it. Astrov leaves to get a drink; Sonya pulls him aside and makes him promise to stop drinking and stop getting her uncle drunk. He agrees. They continue to talk for a moment. He comments that Helen is beautiful but idle and useless. This country life makes people like that, and he despises it; he has been beaten down and sees no light at the end for himself. The peasants are all the same, and educated people are ridiculous. He only likes forests. Sonya compliments him and tries to cheer him up. As he prepares to leave, she asks how he might feel if he were to out that a friend of hers has feelings for him, and he drolly says he cannot love anyone. After he leaves, Sonya feels a surge of happiness though she is not sure why. In Act III, Sonya confesses to Helen that she loves Astrov, and Helen suggests that she say something to see if the doctor loves Sonya too. Sonya gives her permission for Helen to do this. Astrov and Helen meet to ostensibly look at his forestry maps. He discourses volubly on the patterns of deforestation until he sees that Helen is uninterested. Helen insists she is interested but says they should talk about something else. She point-blank asks if he likes Sonya, and he says no. He then moves in to seduce Helen, but she wants none of it. As he tries to kiss her, Vanya enters the room with flowers. Helen is horrified by the situation and begs Vanya to tell her husband that they must leave today. A moment later, Serebryakov and the others enter and Serebryakov announces that he has an idea to sell the estate because he and Helen need to afford a place in the city. This announcement angers Vanya tremendously, and he begins to complain violently about how Serebryakov is a fraud, is uninspired, is thankless, and how he, Vanya, has labored for Serebryakov his whole life and for no reason. He insists this is Sonya's estate. He runs out of the room. Serebryakov is startled by Vanya's outburst. He insists he cannot stay here anymore. Sonya implores him to talk to her uncle and he agrees. He departs, and those in the room hear a gunshot, then another. Helen and Vanya struggle over a revolver as Vanya screeches that he missed the professor. Cursing, he sinks into a chair. In Act IV, Telegin and Marina discuss Serebryakov and Helen's planned departure for that day, then exit the room. Vanya and Astrov come in. Astrov mocks Vanya for his behavior and asks him to return what he stole. Vanya maintains that he is innocent of theft. Astrov laments how this parochial existence crushes people: it is stultifying and useless. When Sonya enters Astrov tells her to tell her uncle to return the bottle of morphia he stole. Sonya turns to her uncle and tearfully asks him for the bottle. He complies. She takes him to make up with her father. Helen enters to tell Astrov goodbye. He tries to seduce her again in a rather lackluster fashion; she kisses him and bids him farewell. Everyone bids goodbye to Serebryakov and Helen, who leave the estate. Sonya and Vanya return to work. Marina suggests Astrov stay for dinner; he refuses and says he must be off. Astrov leaves, and even though Sonya knows he did not love her, she is sad. Vanya, though, claims he is extremely depressed. With both in tears, Sonya comforts her uncle. She tells him that life may be difficult for them now, but the afterlife will be full of peace, love, and rest."
The Comedy of Errors,"Read the full text of The Comedy of Errors with a side-by-side translation HERE. Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse, is spending time in the city of Ephesus. Being in Ephesus means Egeon's life is about to get complicated. Because of some recent strife between the cities of Ephesus and Syracuse, any citizen of either locale caught in the enemy territory is sentenced to death . The Duke of Ephesus explains all of this to Egeon as he hands him a death sentence for trespassing on Ephesian soil. Egeon is eager to get the death sentence - execution is no big deal because his life is pretty crappy - he'll even explain why.A long time ago, Egeon was making a lot of money as a merchant. When his agent died, he went on a business trip with his pregnant wife, who gave birth to identical twin boys while they were away from home. At the same exact time, a poor woman in the same inn also gave birth to identical twin boys. The poor woman sold her boys to Egeon to be servants for his twins. On their way home to Syracuse, a terrible storm overtook the ship that Egeon and his family were sailing in. During the storm, Egeon looked after one of his twin sons and one of the twin servants, as did his wife. However, during the storm, the boat was destroyed and the husband and wife, along with the boys, were separated. Egeon's wife and one set of boys were rescued by a Corinthian ship, and Egeon and the two boys with him were picked up by a ship bound for Epidaurus. Thus separated, Egeon never saw his wife or lost son again.Egeon named his set of boys after their missing twin brothers. He raised the boys until they were 18, at which point his biological son got inquisitive about his lost brother. Egeon's son set off with his servant to find their lost halves. Since then, Egeon has wandered around looking for them. Egeon has now lost all hope, and he welcomes the Duke's death sentence. The Duke gives Egeon until sunset to beg or borrow the money to ransom his life.Meanwhile, the son that Egeon raised in Syracuse has shown up in Ephesus, the very place his dad came to look for him. His name is Antipholus, and his servant's name is Dromio . S. Antipholus sends S. Dromio to go get them a room at a local inn called the Centaur.Just then, Dromio of Ephesus happens upon S. Antipholus and mistakes the Syracusian for his master, Antipholus of Ephesus . E. Dromio bids S. Antipholus to come home to dinner with E. Antipholus's wife. S. Antipholus is reasonably confused, and ends up beating E. Dromio. E. Dromio runs away.E. Dromio goes back to his master's house. Adriana, E. Antipholus' wife, is angry that her husband hasn't returned.S. Dromio, back at the marketplace, meets up with S. Antipholus. S. Antipholus beats S. Dromio for fooling around earlier and telling him weird messages about his ""wife"" wanting him home for dinner. Then the two men are accosted by Adriana , with Luciana in tow. The two women add to the confusion, and they insist S. Dromio and S. Antipholus come home to dinner with them, as they mistake the men for their Ephesian counterparts. S. Antipholus is confused, but he decides to go with the flow and follow this woman who claims to be his wife. S. Dromio is left to play the keeper of the gate at E. Antipholus's house and allow nobody inside.Next, we finally meet the real E. Antipholus, who's been busy with Angelo the goldsmith, making a gold necklace for Adriana. E. Antipholus goes back to his house with E. Dromio, Angelo, and a merchant named Balthazar. The men all arrive expecting to eat dinner, but they get home to find the gate is locked. S. Dromio, who can't see the men through the gate, is taking his gate porter duties really seriously, refusing to let them in.The mayhem only increases, but E. Antipholus and E. Dromio eventually decide to have dinner elsewhere. E. Antipholus asks Angelo the goldsmith to bring him the gold necklace during dinner. Meanwhile, things aren't any prettier inside E. Antipholus's house. S. Antipholus is trying to woo Luciana, his lost-brother's wife's sister. Luciana, unsure of how to respond, deflects his offers and runs off. The situation is getting uncomfortable, so S. Antipholus instructs S. Dromio to go find a ship, so they can get out of this bewitched city. Before he leaves Adriana's house, S. Antipholus is stopped by Angelo the goldsmith. Angelo mistakes S. Antipholus for E. Antipholus, and gives him the golden necklace and refuses payment, saying he knows he'll get paid later. S. Antipholus wants to get out of this place ASAP, but doesn't mind taking such a nice gift.Later in the day at the marketplace, Angelo the goldsmith sees E. Antipholus and approaches his client for payment for the necklace. E. Antipholus, as he never received the necklace, says Angelo must be talking madness. Poor E. Antipholus gets arrested for avoiding paying his debt. The wrongly imprisoned E. Antipholus is furious. S. Dromio approaches and tells E. Antipholus he's secured the ship that S. Antipholus asked for. Since E. Antipholus didn't ask for a ship, he figures Dromio is crazy, too. Wanting to be freed from jail, he sends S. Dromio to Adriana to get bail money. When S. Dromio reaches Adriana and tells her what happened, Adriana sends the servant off with bail money.S. Dromio, rushing back to the marketplace to bail out E. Antipholus, runs into S. Antipholus. S. Dromio tries to give his real master the bail money, but S. Antipholus is confused, and just asks about the ship he sent S. Dromio for a long time ago. E. Antipholus, still arrested, is met by E. Dromio, who knows nothing of his master's arrest. The servant was just receiving a beating when Adriana, Luciana, and a schoolmaster named Pinch arrive. Adriana, thinking her husband is possessed, begs the schoolmaster to cure her husband of whatever demon has possessed him. E. Antipholus is angry and tries to attack Adriana. Ultimately, E. Antipholus and E. Dromio are tied up, and taken to Adriana's house.After the men have been taken away, the women try to clear up E. Antipholus's debt with the arresting officer. As they're puzzling it out, they're encountered by S. Antipholus and S. Dromio. The Syracusians mistake Adriana and company for witches, and run at them with swords drawn. Everyone scampers off.Angelo the goldsmith shows up again and sees that S. Antipholus is wearing the necklace that E. Antipholus denied receiving. S. Antipholus says he never denied anything. The squabble is getting tense and the men are ready to duke it out. Adriana and Co. enter just as the men are about to fight. S. Antipholus and S. Dromio take the opportunity to slip into a conveniently located priory nearby.The Abbess comes out, and asks exactly what all the fuss is about. Adriana begs the Abbess release her husband, but the Abbess refuses, as it would violate their sanctuary in the priory.Just then, the Duke shows up on a merry jaunt to have Egeon beheaded. Adriana wants the Duke to make the Abbess release her husband, but her request is interrupted by a messenger. The messenger says that E. Antipholus and E. Dromio have escaped their bonds, singed Pinch's beard, and are now headed towards the priory to rage against Adriana and Co.Just then, E. Antipholus arrives and pleads for the Duke to deliver justice against his wife, who has much abused him. The Duke throws his hands up and declares everyone is insane. To add to the craziness, Egeon takes this moment to pipe up that he recognizes Antipholus is the son he raised in Syracuse. Of course, E. Antipholus says he's never seen his father in all his life, causing Egeon to despair.This fine kettle of fish is FINALLY de-fishified when the Abbess re-enters the scene with S. Antipholus and S. Dromio in tow. Everyone sees the four men, in two identical sets, face to face. Then they realize what's been going on the whole time. S. Antipholus recognizes his dad, and the Abbess reveals that she's actually Aemilia, Egeon's long lost wife. S. Antipholus takes the opportunity to reiterate his offer of marriage to Luciana. The Duke even frees Egeon! Instead of death and disorder, the play ends with the Abbess calling everybody into the abbey, so they can share the stories of their lives since their separation."
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"An Ancient Mariner, unnaturally old and skinny, with deeply-tanned skin and a ""glittering eye"", stops a Wedding Guest who is on his way to a wedding reception with two companions. He tries to resist the Ancient Mariner, who compels him to sit and listen to his woeful tale. The Ancient Mariner tells his tale, largely interrupted save for the sounds from the wedding reception and the Wedding Guest's fearsome interjections. One day when he was younger, the Ancient Mariner set sail with two hundred other sailors from his native land. The day was sunny and clear, and all were in good cheer until the ship reached the equator. Suddenly, a terrible storm hit and drove the ship southwards into a ""rime"" - a strange, icy patch of ocean. The towering, echoing ""rime"" was bewildering and impenetrable, and also desolate until an Albatross appeared out of the mist. No sooner than the sailors fed it did the ice break and they were able to steer through. As long as the Albatross flew alongside the ship and the sailors treated it kindly, a good wind carried them and a mist followed. One day, however, the Ancient Mariner shot and killed the Albatross on impulse. Suddenly the wind and mist ceased, and the ship was stagnant on the ocean. The other sailors alternately blamed the Ancient Mariner for making the wind die and praised him for making the strange mist disappear. Then things began to go awry. The sun became blindingly hot, and there was no drinkable water amidst the salty ocean, which tossed with terrifying creatures. The sailors went dumb from their thirst and sunburned lips. They hung the Albatross around the Ancient Mariner's neck as a symbol of his sin. After a painful while, a ship appeared on the horizon, and the Ancient Mariner bit his arm and sucked the blood so he could cry out to the other sailors. The ship was strange: it sailed without wind, and when it crossed in front of the sun, its stark masts seemed to imprison the sun. When the ship neared, the Ancient Mariner could see that it was a ghost ship manned by Death, in the form of a man, and Life-in-Death, in the form of a beautiful, naked woman. They were gambling for the Ancient Mariner's soul. Life-in-Death won the Ancient Mariner's soul, and the other sailors were left to Death. The sky went black immediately as the ghost ship sped away. Suddenly all of the sailors cursed the Ancient Mariner with their eyes and dropped dead on the deck. Their souls zoomed out of their bodies, each taunting the Ancient Mariner with a sound like that of his crossbow. Their corpses miraculously refused to rot; they stared at him unrelentingly, cursing him with their eyes. The Ancient Mariner drifted on the ocean in this company, unable to pray. One night he noticed some beautiful water-snakes frolicking at the ship's prow in the icy moonlight. Watching the creatures brought him unprecedented joy, and he blessed them without meaning to. When he was finally able to pray, the Albatross fell from his neck and sank into the sea. He could finally sleep, and dreamed of water. When he awoke, it was raining, and an awesome thunderstorm began. He drank his fill, and the ship began to sail in lieu of wind. Then the dead sailors suddenly arose and sailed the ship without speaking. They sang heavenly music, which the ship's sails continued when they had stopped. Once the ship reached the equator again, the ship jolted, causing the Ancient Mariner to fall unconscious. In his swoon, he heard two voices discussing his fate. They said he would continue to be punished for killing the Albatross, who was loved by a spirit. Then they disappeared. When the Ancient Mariner awoke, the dead sailors were grouped together, all cursing him with their eyes once again. Suddenly, however, they disappeared as well. The Ancient Mariner was not relieved, because he realized that he was doomed to be haunted by them forever. The wind picked up, and the Ancient Mariner spotted his native country's shore. Then bright angels appeared standing over every corpse and waved silently to the shore, serving as beacons to guide the ship home. The Ancient Mariner was overjoyed to see a Pilot, his boy, and a Hermit rowing a small boat out to the ship. He planned to ask the Hermit to absolve him of his sin. Just as the rescuers reached the ship, it sank suddenly and created a vortex in the water. The rescuers were able to pull the Ancient Mariner from the water, but thought he was dead. When he abruptly came to and began to row the boat, the Pilot and Pilot's Boy lost their minds. The spooked Hermit asked the Ancient Mariner what kind of man he was. It was then that the Ancient Mariner learned of his curse; he would be destined to tell his tale to others from beginning to end when an agonizing, physical urge struck him. After he related his tale to the Hermit, he felt normal again. The Ancient Mariner tells the Wedding Guest that he wanders from country to country, and has a special instinct that tells him to whom he must tell his story. After he tells it, he is temporarily relieved of his agony. The Ancient Mariner tells the Wedding Guest that better than any merriment is the company of others in prayer. He says that the best way to become close with God is to respect all of His creatures, because He loves them all. Then he vanishes. Instead of joining the wedding reception, the Wedding Guest walks home, stunned. We are told that he awakes the next day ""sadder and...wiser"" for having heard the Ancient Mariner's tale."
Timon of Athens,"A Poet, Painter, and Jeweler come to Timon's house, hoping to sell him their wares, for Timon is a very generous man. Timon enters. He learns from a messenger that his friend Ventidius is in jail, so he sends money to pay for his freedom. He helps out several other citizens in need, and gladly accepts the works of the Poet and Painter and the jewels of the Jeweler. Apemantus comes to Timon's house, refuses a greeting, and scorns Timon's flatterers. Alcibiades arrives, and Timon greets him. Timon throws a feast at his home, and all his friends are in attendance. Apemantus declares he has come merely to be an observer of the villainous flatterers who fill Timon's house. Timon speaks of his fondness for his friends and the pleasure he finds in giving them gifts, all without expectation of a return. Timon's servant Flavius worries that Timon will run out of money if he keeps being so generous. Most of Athens's citizens are amazed that Timon continues to be so generous, as it seems to them that Timon must have some magical power to possess such an unending bounty. Three creditors, friends of Timon who lend him money, call their debts due, and send servants to Timon's door with bills in hand. Timon tries to dismiss them, but they won't be sent away. Timon asks Flavius why he has creditors at the door, and Flavius explains that Timon has no money and is in debt. Timon orders him to sell his land, but it is already mortgaged. Timon asks why Flavius never told him about the state of his affairs before, and Flavius insists that he had tried, but Timon always refused to listen. Flavius says that everyone loved Timon, but when his finances are gone, those who praised him will abandon him too. Timon doesn't believe him, and sends servants to ask his friends for loans, but Flavius says he has already tried that, and no one would lend him anything. Each of three of Timon's servants arrives at one of Timon's friend's houses to ask for a loan, but each man refuses. Servants ask the newly released Ventidius for a loan also, but he refuses. Creditors' servants swarm around Timon's house, though they note how strange it is that their masters wear gifts from Timon while they demand payment on loans he took out from them in order to buy them gifts. Timon is enraged to be trapped in his house by groups of creditors' servants, and plans a last dinner party. Timon invites all his friends and other Lords. Timon says grace over the covered dishes, asking the gods to be sure to never give too much to mankind, always hold something back, and to never ask for anything back, for mankind will abandon them. Then he reveals stones and boiling water. Timon curses the flattery of his alleged friends, and leaves Athens. Meanwhile Alcibiades argues with the Senators about the fate of one of his friends, sentenced to death for having killed a man in a rage. Alcibiades tries to save his friend, but ends up annoying the senate so much that they banish Alcibiades. Alcibiades leaves, planning to raise an army to attack Athens. Timon sets off into the wilderness. His servants mourn his departure, sad that someone could fall so far from being so generous. Flavius shares out his last money and sets off to serve Timon in the wilderness. Timon searches for food in the forest, only to discover a hidden cache of gold. Struck by the irony of his discovery now that he no longer needs it, Timon buries the gold again, keeping some. Then he is visited by all manner of men in the woods, starting with Alcibiades. When he hears Alcibiades's intention to destroy Athens, he gives him a donation in gold and urges him to massacre everyone. Apemantus comes to Timon's cave in the forest and scorns him, remarking that his fall came about from being so generous to a bunch of no-good flatterers. The two insult each other, then Timon remarks that he is so miserable to have fallen because he never knew suffering, but Apemantus has, though he has never known such a horror as base flattery--so why does he hate humanity? Timon is the one who really has reason for such a response. The two men discuss their desires to turn the world over to the beasts, but end in insults, and Apemantus departs. Then Flavius arrives, offering Timon his last money and weeping. Impressed at this show of pity, Timon realizes Flavius was the one honest man he came in contact with in Athens, and he is the one man who is able to escape his enthusiastic cursing of humanity. Timon gives him gold and orders him to leave. The Poet and Painter have heard Timon has gold, so they arrive to ingratiate themselves to him. Timon sends them off on a wild goose chase. Later Flavius returns with two senators who announce that the people have determined Timon's treatment was unfair, and they want him to return to Athens. Timon refuses. The senators believe Timon's presence in Athens will somehow halt Alcibiades's invasion, but they can't shift Timon. Alcibiades arrives at the gates of Athens. The senators attempt to defend the city, explaining that not everyone in Athens insulted Alcibiades and Timon, and they ask that Alcibiades come into the city in peace, without killing everyone. Alcibiades agrees, and punishes only those who have slighted himself and Timon. Then a soldier arrives with news that Timon has died, and Alcibiades reads his epitaph. Though he died thinking everyone hated him, Alcibiades honors Timon, a man much more admired in Athens than he believed."
Antony and Cleopatra,"Attended by Egyptian and Romans at Cleopatra's palace in Alexandria, Antony and Cleopatra are the celebrity couple of the known world. Antony's men watch disapprovingly as, from their perspective, a mighty Roman general is reduced to a whore's fool. But Antony and Cleopatra themselves seem above this crude appraisal, and their love affair is full of drama, extravagant gestures, and decadence. Absorbed in the luxuriant life of the East and his passion for Cleopatra, Antony ignores his duties as triumvir until affairs reach a boiling point. Their idyllic life is interrupted when Antony receives bad news from different parts of the empire. His wife Fulvia and his brother have made war on Octavius, his fellow triumvir. Parthia, an Eastern superpower and Rome's most powerful adversary, has overrun much of the Near and Middle East. His wife has died. These developments force Antony back to Rome. Accompanying him, among others, is the cynical Roman soldier Enobarbus, whose cutting insights make him one of the play's most memorable characters. Antony parts from Cleopatra, who puts on a great show of anger and distrust; he does his best to assure her that his heart will remain with her. Back in Rome, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, the other two triumvirs, are in sore need of Antony. Octavius, nephew and adopted son of Julius Caesar, fumes about Antony's negligence. Pompey, a dangerous adversary, controls the seas around Italy, threatening the authority of the triumvirate. Act Two. When Antony finally returns, tension between himself and Octavius remains high. To seal the men's alliance, a marriage is brokered between Antony and Octavia, Octavius' sister. A soothsayer warns Antony that he must stay away from Caesar, for in any contest between them, Caesar will prevail. Back in Alexandria, Cleopatra takes the news of Antony's marriage rather poorly, beating the messenger and threatening him with a knife. The triumvirate meets with Pompey, and forces a rather disadvantageous peace on him. Antony's presence is enough to frighten Pompey into submission. That night, when Pompey feasts the triumvirs, his subordinate Menas offers to murder the three men and make Pompey unchallenged ruler of the Roman world. Pompey declines the offer because of his sense of honor, but he does so with some regret. Act Three. Octavia and Octavius have an emotional parting, and Antony takes her with him to Athens. Cleopatra, back in Egypt, has trained her messenger to give only good news. She has not given up, even though Antony is married, and plans to win him back. Some time elapses between 3.3 and 3.4, and in the interim the balance of power changes radically. Antony frets in Athens: Octavius has moved, unapproved, against Pompey. He has slandered Antony's character, and seems to be preparing for war against Antony. Antony sends his wife to act as emissary to her brother. By 3.5, the situation has deteriorated further. Pompey is dead, and Octavius has imprisoned Lepidus, taking his power and possessions unto himself. By 3.6, Antony has apparently returned to Egypt, where he has bequeathed kingdoms unto Cleopatra and their bastard children. Caesar receives his sister in Rome, and prepares for war. The war is rapid, and Antony makes a series of strategic blunders. He confronts Octavius by sea, even though victory seems more likely by land. Octavius defeats Antony and Cleopatra decisively at the sea battle of Actium. The turning point in the battle comes when Cleopatra panics and flees, taking sixty ships with her, and Antony follows, abandoning his men. Many of Antony's men, disgusted by this total lapse in duty, desert him. Enobarbus, however, remains loyal. Back in Alexandria, Antony is overcome with grief and humiliation by what he has done. Now, he has no chance of defeating Octavius. But anger with himself and Cleopatra turns quickly to resignation, as he decides to feast and drink despite their impending doom. Act Four. Antony grows increasingly irrational as the end approaches, swinging between extreme emotions, challenging Caesar to single combat, abusing a messenger, giving parting gifts to friends, and indulging in great feasts. Enobarbus finally defects to Caesar's camp. Antony sends his treasure after him, and Enobarbus feels such remorse that he dies of grief. The fleet deserts Antony, and he is convinced that Cleopatra has betrayed him. Afraid of his wrath, Cleopatra closes herself in her monument and sends false word that she is dead. Ever quick to forgive, Antony resolves to kill himself to join her. He tries to get his servant Eros to slay him, but Eros kills himself to avoid the duty. Antony falls on his own sword, and too late word comes from Cleopatra that she is still alive. Soldiers bring him to her, and she and her maids hoist him up into the monument. He gives her final advice about whom to trust in Caesar's camp, and dies. Cleopatra is grief-stricken. Act Five. Caesar is moved to tears when Antony's blood sword is brought to him. He sends men to Cleopatra, determined to keep her alive so that he may parade her through the streets of Rome in his triumphal procession. Emissaries go to Cleopatra, but one of them, Dolabella, warns her that Caesar plans to parade her through Rome. This makes up her mind. She meets with Caesar, and seems obedient to his wishes. But after he leaves, she has servants smuggle an asp into her monument. The poison of the asp's bite is deadly and swift. She and her ladies-in-waiting use the poisonous snake to commit suicide. Caesar arrives, and cannot help but respect her final act of defiance. He orders his men to bury Antony and Cleopatra together. They will respectfully attend the funeral before returning to Rome. All opposition has been crushed, and Octavius can now begin his reign as Rome's first Emperor."
The Playboy of the Western World,"In a short preface to his play, Synge emphasizes a link between the imagination of the Irish country people and their speech itself, which is ""rich and living."" He credits the Irish people for having such a ""fiery,"" ""magnificent"" language, and further credits himself for having both the presence of mind and poetic vision to recognize those virtues. The entire play is set in a public house ""on the wild coast of Mayo,"" outside a village in Northwestern Ireland, circa 1907 . Pegeen Mike, daughter to the alehouse owner, sits alone in the pub, writing a letter to order supplies for her upcoming wedding to Shawn Keogh. Her father, Michael James, has left her for the evening, while he attends a wake. Shawn Keogh enters, remarking upon the frightening darkness outside. Pegeen asks him to stay with her, since the night makes her nervous as well. Shawn refuses, claiming it would be improper for him to be alone with her until they are wed. However, he offers to send the Widow Quin to stay with her. Shawn then reveals that he heard a man outside, wailing from a ditch. Michael James enters, along with his friends Philly and Jimmy. They are drunk, and have not yet left for the wake. Michael James demands Shawn stay with Pegeen, but Shawn refuses, fearing the disapproval of the parish priest. Shawn flees before the men can trap him, but quickly returns to tell them that he saw a face looking up out of the ditch. Christy Mahon, frightened and dirty, enters the pub. A shy young man, he simply wishes to warm himself by the fire, but soon enough reveals that he is on the run from the police. He tries to avoid talking about it, but the men pester him until he admits that he killed his father. The group is greatly impressed by this news, and to meet a man who could kill his own father. Michael James offers him a job on the spot, noting that Christy could keep Pegeen company this evening. Michael, Philly and Jimmy then leave for their wake, and a very-intrigued Pegeen chases Shawn away. Pegeen admires Christy, complimenting him on his physique, his face, his speech and his courage. Christy swells with unfamiliar pride. Widow Quin appears, having heard about Christy from Shawn. The widow tries to seduce him, but Pegeen insults and sends her off. As she leaves, however, the widow refers to Pegeen's impending nuptials with Shawn. This news devastates Christy, since he has fallen for her. However, she assures him she would never marry a coward like Shawn, and then heads off to bed. Before he falls asleep, Christy muses to himself that he would have killed his father much sooner if he had known it would bring him such respect and fortune. Three village girls arrive the next morning to see the man they have heard gossip about. They giggle and flirt with him until Widow Quin arrives, announcing that she has registered Christy for a sports competition being held later on the beach. The girls joke that the widow and Christy would make a fine match. As they eat breakfast, Christy tells more about the murder, about how he rebelled when his father promised him to a widow whom he did not want to marry. When his father lifted a scythe as their argument grew vicious, Christy struck back with a spade, hitting the old man on the head and killing him. Pegeen enters, and chases the women out. Jealous, she accuses Christy of flirting, which he denies. The two exchange kind, tender words. They're falling in love. Shawn and Widow Quin re-enter, and alert Pegeen that her sheep have wandered off. Pegeen rushes out, leaving them alone. Shawn offers Christy a one-way ticket to America and all his fine clothes if he promises to leave the village. Christy rejects his offer, but the widow encourages him to try on Shawn's clothes anyway. Christy agrees, and leaves the room to change. Once Christy is gone, Shawn promises to give the widow animals and wealth if she can find a way to interfere with Christy and Pegeen's affair. The widow strikes a deal with Shawn, promising to lure Christy into marrying her, not Pegeen. Content, Shawn leaves. Christy struts back in wearing Shawn's clothes, but staggers back when he sees the spirit of his ""murdered da"" outside the window . He hides just as Old Mahon, his father, enters. Old Mahon, a bandage round his bloodied head, describes Christy and then asks whether the widow has seen someone matching that description. The widow sends Mahon off to the docks, claiming she saw the boy waiting to board a steamer. Mahon exits. Christy panics over his father's ""resurrection"" . Knowing that Pegeen loves him for his murderous heroism, he worries she will leave him. He begs the widow to help him, which she agrees to do in exchange for privileges once he becomes master of the pub. The girls who visited earlier arrive to lead Christy down to the beach for the sports competition. Alone, the widow admits that Christy will eventually turn to her once the truth comes out and Pegeen drops him. Jimmy and Philly enter the empty pub, discussing how Christy has dominated the competition. They also admit that his constant boasting about his patricide annoys them. Old Mahon re-enters the pub. Showing the men his wound, he asks again after his son. Right as the men begin to grow suspicious, Widow Quin enters and confides to Jimmy and Philly that Mahon is crazy, and has co-opted Christy's story for attention. When the men try to interrogate Mahon further, the widow interjects to distract them. When the cheering from the beach reaches the pub, Mahon looks out to widow to see the competition's champion: Christy. The widow convinces him that he is seeing things because of his head injury, and he anxiously leaves to admit himself to an insane asylum. Jimmy and Philly leave with him. Christy and Pegeen enter with the crowd, who celebrate Christy and then leave to watch the final competition on the beach. Alone now with Pegeen, Christy proposes marriage, and she accepts. Michael James, still drunk from the wake, enters with Shawn. Now perturbed about Christy's influence on his daughter, Michael insists she will marry Shawn. Pegeen defies her father and announces her intention to marry Christy, and Michael encourages Shawn to fight Christy for her. When Shawn cowardly refuses, Michael decides to bless Christy and Pegeen's match. Outside, a cry goes up as Old Mahon bursts into the pub, rushing at Christy and knocking him down. When the older man reveals the truth, Pegeen repudiates Christy. He then begs mercy from her and the crowd, but they will not grant it. Pegeen urges Mahon to take his son away, but Christy resists Mahon. The crowd eggs on the fight between father and son until Christy turns on them with a spade. He then chases his father from the pub, the spade held high. Everyone rushes out to watch. Offstage, there is a loud cry and then silence. Christy stumbles back in, dazed. Widow Quin follows, urging Christy to run, since the crowd has turned against him. But Christy believes that Pegeen will take him back now that he has actually killed his father. He is wrong. From the doorway, Michael, Philly and Pegeen throw a loop of rope around Christy, confining his arms and torso. Christy asks Pegeen whether she will take him back, but she asserts there is a difference between a ""gallous story"" and a ""dirty deed"" . Writhing on the floor, Christy threatens to kill them and bites Shawn in the leg. Pegeen burns Christy with a hot poker. Worked up, Christy conjures the welcome he shall receive from Satan once he has been hanged. But then Mahon crawls back in, demanding to know why his son is bound. He releases Christy, who then asks whether the man has returned to be killed a third time. Old Mahon tells the group that he and Christy will talk of County Mayo's villainy for years to come. However, Christy will not leave peacefully with Mahon, whom he pushes roughly, declaring that his departure is that of a ""gallant captain with his heathen slave"" . Old Mahon is amazed and delighted by this change in his son. They then leave together. Shawn approaches Pegeen to remind her of their wedding engagement. She boxes Shawn's ear and sends him out. Crying wildly, she laments that she has ""lost the only Playboy of the Western World"" ."
The Duchess of Malfi,"The Duchess of Malfi takes place in Italy, mostly at the Duchess's palace in Malfi, in the sixteenth century. The Duchess is a young widow whose two brothers, Ferdinand and the Cardinal, are visiting her from Rome at the play's start. Antonio, the manager of her household, has just returned from France. Before leaving the Duchess, Ferdinand engages Bosola, previously used by the Cardinal as a hit man, to ostensibly manage the Duchess's horses, but in reality to spy on her for the brothers so they can be sure she remains chaste and does not remarry. Bosola is reluctant, but eventually agrees. Before they return to Rome, Ferdinand and the Cardinal lecture the Duchess about the impropriety of remarriage. She insists that she has no plans for remarriage, and shows some irritation at their attempts to control her. However, as soon as they leave, she sets in motion a plan to propose to Antonio with the help of her maid, Cariola. Antonio and the Duchess marry, and the Duchess reassures Antonio that they will find a way to appease her brothers. Act Two is set about nine months later. The Duchess is pregnant and Bosola, suspecting her condition, hatches a plan to prove it to himself by giving her apricots, thought to induce labor. She accepts them, and immediately becomes ill, rushing off to her bedroom. Antonio and Delio discuss how to keep her labor secret. Bosola now assumes his belief is correct, but finds further definitive proof through a horoscope Antonio wrote for the infant. With the information confirmed, Bosola he writes a letter to the Duchess's brothers to tell them the news. The brothers are both incensed, but the Cardinal maintains a cool calm, whereas Ferdinand grows erratically angry. Neither of them realizes that she is married, and hence assume the baby is a bastard. Ferdinand says he won't take any action until he knows who the baby's father is. Act Three begins about two years later, with Delio's return to the Duchess's palace. Antonio and the Duchess have had two more children in the meantime. Ferdinand has recently arrived, and both Antonio and Delio suspect that he knows about the Duchess's children. Ferdinand surprises the Duchess in her bedroom, and when she tells him that she is married, he tells her she should never reveal to him the name of her lover lest terrible violence then be unleashed on all of them. He further banishes her forever from his sight. The Duchess, who wishes to protect Antonio by removing him from Malfi, falsely claims he has stolen from her and hence has him banished to Ancona. Once he has left, Bosola defends his virtue to the Duchess so emphatically that she admits the secret of their marriage. Bosola pretends to support her, and she sends him after Antonio with money and news that she will soon follow him. In Ancona a few days later, the Cardinal catches up to them and banishes the Duchess and her family from there. On their way out of town, Bosola brings her an ostensibly forgiving but actually threatening letter from Ferdinand, and so the Duchess, fearing an ambush, tells Antonio to separate from her with their oldest son. Immediately after they part, Bosola and a group of soldiers take the Duchess and her two remaining children captive and bring them back to her palace. In Act Four, Bosola tells Ferdinand that the Duchess is bearing her imprisonment nobly, which angers him. In an effort to make her insane with despair, he presents her with wax corpses of her family to convince her they have died. Though Bosola pleas with Ferdinand to cease his torture, he won't listen, and instead sends a group of madmen to torment her. Bosola returns, disguised as a tomb-maker, and prepares the Duchess for her impending death. Executioners follow with a cord to strangle her, but the Duchess remains steadfastly calm and courageous, at peace with the idea of rejoining her family, who she still believes are dead. They strangle her. Bosola next orders her children and Cariola killed. Cariola pleads for her life, to no avail. When Ferdinand confronts the Duchess's body, he is suddenly overtaken with remorse and angry at Bosola for following his orders. He not only betrays Bosola by refusing the latter a promised reward, but also shows signs of insanity before he exits. The Duchess shows a final sign of life, and before she truly dies, Bosola tells her that Antonio is still alive. Bosola shows genuine sadness when she dies. In Act Five, Antonio, ignorant of his wife and children's deaths, plans to beg the Cardinal that night for a reconciliation. Ferdinand has now completely lost his mind and is afflicted with lycanthropia, or the belief that he is a wolf. Bosola arrives and the Cardinal pretends that he has no idea about the Duchess's death. He offers Bosola a great reward for the murder of Antonio, an offer Bosola accepts even though he is plotting revenge. Julia, the Cardinal's mistress, approaches Bosola, declaring her love for him, and Bosola uses her to get the Cardinal to admit his involvement in the Duchess's murder. After the Cardinal kills Julia, Bosola reveals he has overheard the secret and demands his reward killing the Duchess. The Cardinal, once again, promises it will come after he has killed Antonio and helped him get rid of Julia's body. Bosola pretends to agree, but tells the audience that he will find Antonio to either protect him or help him get his vengeance against the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal tells his courtiers to stay away no matter what they hear from him or Ferdinand, ostensibly because Ferdinand's madness gets worse when people are around, but actually because he wants privacy with which to dispose of Julia's body. Bosola, waiting outside the Cardinal's room, accidentally kills Antonio, who has come to see the Cardinal. Distraught, he goes into the Cardinal's room and attacks him. Because of the Cardinal's warning, his courtiers at first ignore his cries for help. Ferdinand joins the fray and stabs both the Cardinal and Bosola. Bosola kills Ferdinand. The courtiers finally enter in time to see the Cardinal and Bosola die, but not before the latter has confessed the particulars of the situation. Delio enters with Antonio and the Duchess's oldest son, who is the sole survivor of the family. Delio and the courtiers promise to raise the boy as a legacy to his parents, which gives the play a final glimmer of hope."
The Secret Garden,"Mary Lennox starts out in India with her parents. She is in a village, where an outbreak of cholera kills everyone except for her. She is sent to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven. He lives in a place called Misselthwaite Manor, where there are more than 100 rooms. Mr. Craven has been in grief for 10 years since his wife died. When she arrives, she overhears Martha Sowerby, her servant and maid, talk about a secret garden. This garden is where Archibald's wife died. Archibald locked the garden and hid the key because the garden reminded him of his wife. Mary wants to find this garden and the key. Martha gets her a skipping rope, and after she skips for a while, she becomes a better person, both physically and emotionally. She makes friends with Ben Weatherstaff, the gardener, the Robin, and Martha and her family. She is especially fond of Dickon, who is good with animals and plants. She begins to hear cries coming from another room in the manor. Nobody will tell her who it comes from, and she is forbidden to find out, so she decides to secretly find out for herself, where she meets Colin Archibald, who was born told that he would die, was raised in his own room with servants who had to do what he wanted them to do. Also, his face was so similar to Archibald's wife that Archibald couldn't bear to see it. However, she is distracted because the Robin has found a mysterious key. She finds out where the secret garden is and tries to bring it back to life with Dickon. Mary meets with him every so often, but he gets mad when she goes to the garden instead of talking with him. He goes into one of his temper tantrums, and Mary has to yell at him to be quiet. She proves to him that he has no problem on his back. Mary and Dickon bring Colin down to the garden, where he learns to walk. Mary, Dickon, Colin, and Ben Weatherstaff take care of it and raise it back into a thriving, beautiful garden. He also gets a better attitude, and when his father comes home, he runs to him and shows him the garden."
The Age of Innocence,"The novel opens in 1870s New York on a January evening. All of New York's high society is gathered for a production of Gounod's opera Faust, including Newland Archer, recently engaged to pretty May Welland. The appearance of May's cousin, the controversial Countess Olenska, who is--gasp!--separated from her husband, causes a stir in New York society and turns Newland Archer's world upside down. It does not turn his frown upside down, however. Countess Olenska settles in a bohemian neighborhood and leads an unconventional lifestyle. Remember that unconventional in 1870s New York essentially means she eats her fish course with a salad fork. Serious faux-pas. Over the course of the next few weeks, Newland finds himself having the hots for Countess Olenska. In an effort to get over his attraction to her, he flees to the Wellands's vacation home in St. Augustine, Florida, to persuade May to speed up their wedding date. Cool strategy, bro. But when he returns to New York he finds himself unable to get over Madame Olenska. He tells her he like-likes her, but she rejects his advances. This isn't because she doesn't like-like him back, though. She thinks that running off with her cousin's fiance would be a scumbag move, and Little Old New York has a thing against scumbagginess. Part I ends as both Madame Olenska and Newland Archer receive telegrams from May, announcing the ""happy"" news that her parents have agreed to a drastically shortened engagement period. Cue a collective forced smile. Part II takes up the story again in April. Newland and May are married and they leave immediately for a honeymoon in Europe. They tour Switzerland and France and end their trip in London. Newland wants to take in the art and culture and expand his mind, man, but May is mostly concerned with fashion and shopping. Newland thinks, ""Huh. We don't seem to have much in common,"" but keeps that thought to himself. When they return, they settle into married life, and Newland has no contact with Madame Olenska, who has moved to Washington, DC. But that summer, while on vacation in Newport, Rhode Island, Newland sees Madame Olenska again and his eyeballs turn into cartoon hearts. He tracks her down in Boston, where they talk about how they love each other but can't do a dang thing about it. Longing glances are exchanged. Saxophone music is probably playing in the background. On Newland's return to New York, there is a crash on Wall Street, and Madame Olenska returns to New York to take care of her grandmother. Newland and Madame Olenska finally decide to consummate their love by having a passionate night of knocking boots before she leaves New York for good. But before they meet again, Madame Olenska ghosts and abruptly leaves for Washington, DC. A week later, May hosts a farewell dinner for Madame Olenska, who is now leaving for Paris. Newland is bummed. Womp womp. That night, Archer attempts to tell May about his feelings for Madame Olenska, but she tells him that she's pregnant. Not only that, but May told Madame Olenska that she was pregnant a couple weeks before. This explains why Newland and Madame Olenska never got to get it on -- Madame Olenska wasn't cool with sleeping with the hubby of a preggo woman. The novel ends twenty-six years later. Newland and May have had three children, all grown up, and May has recently died. They've had a pleasant dull life. Newland's son Dallas invites him to go to Europe with him. In Paris Dallas accepts an invitation for a father-son date at Madame Olenska's. When they arrive at her home, Newland decides not to join his son at Madame Olenska's and returns to the hotel without having seen her."
Ethan Frome,"The narrator tells us that he met Ethan Frome while working for a power plant in rural Massachusetts. The closest town to the plant is Starksfield, and there the narrator gets a taste of life in rural New England. Frome is the most striking character in town, a tall and lame ""ruin of a man,"" and the narrator becomes obsessed with learning Frome's story. He gathers bits of the tale from various sources around town. By chance, Frome ends up being his sleigh driver to work every morning. After about a week of riding with Frome, a terrible blizzard makes the trek all the way back to the narrator's home impossible. He is forced to take shelter at Frome's home, and there he gets the clue to Frome's tragedy. The narrator presents his vision of Frome's story to us. We then switch to a third-person narrator and move twenty-four years into the past. Frome is a young man. Although he briefly pursued higher education in the sciences, the death of his father necessitated his return to the family farm. His mother was ill, and his cousin Zeena came to care for her. After his mother died, Ethan married Zeena out of loneliness. Zeena became more sickly and fussy as time passed, and their marriage has been loveless. But a year ago, Zeena's cousin, Mattie Silver, came to help Zeena with the housework. Ethan has fallen in love with her. Tonight, he is fetching Mattie back from a church dance. Their walks together are some of Ethan's happiest moments, but he has never really considered acting on his feelings. On the way back, they talk affectionately to each other, and at some point Ethan puts his arm around Mattie to prevent her from falling. It is the most intimate physical contact they have ever had, and she does not push him away. Zeena is waiting up for them when they return, and the contrast between Zeena and Mattie could not be more defined. The next day, Zeena decides to leave for Bettsbridge to see a doctor; she has been particularly ill lately. For the first time since Mattie arrived, Ethan and Mattie are going to be alone together overnight. Ethan goes about his work joyfully, and he comes home for supper to find Mattie dressed more nicely than usual. She has gone to some trouble to make the supper table look festive, and she and Ethan try to have a pleasant evening together. But Zeena is an oppressive presence even when she is absent, and the conversation between Ethan and Mattie becomes strained and awkward. Later that night, as they are sitting in front of the fire, Ethan takes hold of the piece of cloth Mattie is sewing. With her working on the other end of it, he kisses it gently. Mattie rolls up her work and makes her way to bed. Zeena returns the next day. The doctor has told her that she has ""complications,"" meaning that her illness is serious. She has already hired a new girl to come and help with the housework, and she plans to send Mattie packing. Ethan is crushed. But Zeena is adamant, and her decision is final. That night, Ethan kisses Mattie for the first time. The next day, Ethan takes Mattie to the train station. They take a long ride and do some walking together, and both confess their love for one another. They decide to go sledding, something they had planned on but had never gotten around to. The first ride down the hill is exhilarating. On the way back up, both break down into tears. Mattie asks Ethan to take them down on a second ride, but this time she wants him to steer them into the big elm tree at the bottom of the hill. She wants to die with him. Ethan does as she asks. But the suicide attempt is unsuccessful. Both of them live. We move to twenty-four years later, with the narrator entering the Frome's home. In the kitchen there are two women: one tall and severe, and the other shriveled and paralyzed. The paralyzed woman is foul and hateful: Ethan introduces her as Miss Mattie Silver. We finish with the narrator talking to Mrs. Hale, the old widow with whom he lodges. Mrs. Hale tells him that after the accident, Mattie had nowhere to go. The Fromes took her in. Zeena, once so sickly, somehow has found the strength to take care of all of them. Not many people go to the Frome farm anymore; Mrs. Hale is an old friend of theirs, and she visits once or twice a year, but she always finds the experience painful. She cannot bear the expression of suffering on Ethan's face. Mrs. Hale confides in the narrator that she thinks it would have been better if Mattie Silver had died. Ethan, Mattie, and Zeena are three ruined and bitter people, doomed to spend the rest of their lives under the same roof."
Bleak House,"The term ""Bleak House"" refers to two different houses -- the one owned originally by John Jarndyce, to which Ada, Esther, and Richard come to live with him, and to the second Bleak House, built for Esther and her husband at the end of the book. That said, the Bleak Houses in Bleak House are not bleak at all. They are happy houses. The title of the book is more indicative of the social ills and hypocrisy that Dickens addresses in it. Sir Leicester Dedlock is introduced as the height of British Aristocracy. He has a home in rural Lincolnshire called Chesney Wold. His beautiful wife lives with him, and is the apex of the fashionable world. She hides a terrible secret -- before she met Sir Leicester she bore an illegitimate child with her lover Captain Hawdon. She thinks that child has died. This child, Esther Summerson, has been raised by her godmother, who she finds out is really her aunt. After this aunt dies Esther is given into the care of a guardian, Mr. John Jarndyce, a kindly man who educates her and brings her to his house to be the companion of his other ward, Ada Clare. Ada Clare and her distant cousin Richard Carstone live together with Mr. Jarndyce, as wards of the long complicated Chancery suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce. They are thought to be likey beneficiaries of a large inheritance, but the endless nature of the proceedings, and the delays of the Court of Chancery, make this very unlikely. Esther, Ada, and Richard become close friends, and Ada and Richard fall in love. Lady Dedlock sees a legal paper that her husband's lawyer, Mr. Tulkinghorn, brings to Chesney Wold. She recongnizes the handwriting as her presumed dead lover, Captain Hawdon. Tulkinghorn investigates, and finds out that the the hand is that of Nemo , an impoverished law writer and opium addict who lives above a dillapitated rag-and-bottle shop owned by Mr. Krook. Tulkinghorn discovers Nemo dead. He has no family, and the only person who seems to have anything to say about him is a street orphan called Jo. Richard Carstone cannot settle on one occupation, and soon becomes engrossed in the Jarndyce and Jarndyce suit, which consumes all his money and his health. He marries Ada Clare in secret. Esther has an admirer in the young Dr. Woodcourt, who loves her even though her face has been scarred by smallpox, which she contracted while caring for Jo, who suffered from the disease. Soon, Esther learns that Lady Dedlock is her mother, and they have one impassioned reunion. They cannot acknowledge one another publically, however, for fear of ruining Sir Leicester's reputation. Lady Dedlock changes clothing with her maid Hortense, and goes to find Jo. Jo shows her where Hawdon is buried, in a pauper's grave. Tulkinghorn is aware that Lady Dedlock has a secret, and he pursues it ruthlessly. Hortense is dismissed by Lady Dedlock, and, in a vengeful rage, helps Tulkinghorn to find out Lady Dedlock's secret. Tulkinghorn says that he will keep her illegitimate daughter secret out of deference to Sir Leicester, unless Lady Dedlock does something to make him do otherwise. Tulkinhorn had promised to help Hortense find another job, but refuses to do so, so Hortense curses him. Later, Tulkinghorn is shot in his own chambers. John Jarndyce reveals his love for Esther is more than that of a guardian for his ward, and the two become engaged. Mr. Bucket, a detective, gathers suspects in Tulkinghorn's murder. George Rouncewell, a former soldier and friend of Captain Hawdon, is suspected, as is Lady Dedlock. Sir Leicester is told of his wife's illegitimate daughter, and of her hatred for Tulkinghorn. Shocked, Sir Leicester suffers a stroke. He forgives his wife fully, however. Bucket later finds Hortense to be the murderer, and arrests her. Because Lady Dedlock doesn't know of the arrest of Hortense and the forgiveness of her husband, in desperation she leaves the house and changes clothes with a poor woman to evade any pursuers. Esther and Detective Bucket attempt to find her, but arrive too late at the gate of the cemetery where Lady Dedlock's lover, Captain Hawdon, is buried. Lady Dedlock has died in the snow. The case of Jarndyce & Jarndyce is wound up with the surprise discovery of a later will found in Krook's shop. Ada and Richard are indeed the beneficiaries, but there is no money left to inherit. It has all been consumed in legal fees. Richard dies, and Ada gives birth to his son. John Jarndyce realizes that Esther loves Allan Woodcourt more than she loves him, and Woodcourt and Esther are married. They have children, and Ada and Jarndyce are frequent visitors to the new ""Bleak House"" they create in Yorkshire."
The Education of Henry Adams,"""Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than he,"" the narrator says of the birth of Henry Brooks Adams in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 16, 1838. Through a series of impressions, he introduces the reader to Henry's boyhood world. Winters in Boston are filled with restraint, rules, confinement, school, and a sense of order that is thrillingly interrupted by wild snowball fights. Summers at his paternal grandparents' home in nearby Quincy bring freedom, delight, hope, and a close relationship with Grandfather John Quincy Adams, formerly the sixth President of the United States. Henry is a child of privilege; that, as much as anything, shapes the outer direction of his life. But his world is rapidly changing, a theme that will affect Henry's education throughout the book. Social change comes first. A trip to Maryland, Virginia and Washington D. C., with his father in 1850, introduces Henry to life in the near South, its appealing informality contrasting with the horrors of slavery, which the Adams family is devoted to eradicating even though it will mean Civil War. The style of the book affects the reader's understanding. The narrator is Henry in his late sixties; he speaks in the third person, treating the younger Henry objectively except for occasional insights into the boy's attitudes. The reader rarely sees Henry's emotions. Adams speaks of the key figure as a manikin and his education as the various costumes draped across it. The reader soon learns that Adams is using the term ""education"" in an unusual, broad sense. He has little use for formal schooling, including Harvard College where Henry, as told in the book, is an average student but a good writer and speaker, graduating in 1858 as the Class Orator. During a two-year ""Grand Tour"" of Europe, Henry makes a lame effort at studying law but finds that his German is inadequate and ends up devoting a term to learning the language in a Berlin prep school. He returns to work as a private secretary to his father, a Congressman, in Washington during the winter of 1860-1861. Having published some travel letters in the Boston Daily Courier while in Europe, Henry becomes the part-time Washington correspondent for the Boston Daily Advertiser during the winter of political turmoil leading up to the secession of many of the slave states. Henry continues to serve as his father's private secretary during Charles Francis Adams's tenure as Minister to England . Frail and small , perhaps as the result of a nearly fatal bout of scarlet fever as a child, Henry is not a likely warrior and completely misses the American Civil War . Nevertheless, the war years do contribute to Henry's education and are especially intriguing because his father's Legation deals with pro-Confederate sympathies in England, and he successfully struggles to keep Britain officially neutral. Henry's writing career progresses despite some bumps. He is the secret London correspondent of the New York Times for several months even though he knows that exposure would embarrass his father and the American Legation; he resigns only after nearly being discovered. After Henry returns to the States in July 1868, he works as a freelance political journalist in Washington, earning a reputation as a reformer, especially in articles dealing with American finance and the New York gold conspiracy. The most poignant passage of the book concerns the death of Henry's sister Louisa. While vacationing in Europe, Henry learns that she has been in a cab accident near her home in Italy. He rushes to her side, but tetanus has already set in; she suffers an excruciating death a few days later. Henry is despondent and seeks solace in a monastery in England. Soon he receives a letter from the president of Harvard, offering a position as assistant professor of history and editor of the prestigious North American Review. He accepts the offer. Despite Adams's self-effacing claims to the contrary, Henry is an effective, innovative teacher and editor. He pioneers the use of the seminar system, advocates the study of American history, introduces graduate studies in history, and encourages student evaluations as well as the keeping of journals. During the summer after his first academic year , he meets Clarence King on a geological expedition in Estes Park; King becomes a lifelong friend. The Education simply skips the next twenty years . Rarely at ease with emotion or personal matters, Adams apparently avoids discussing the period because of his marriage to Marian Hooper and her suicide on December 6, 1885, which he never even mentions in the book. He does say that his life has been cut in two; in his letters, he refers to the rest of his life as ""posthumous."" However, some of his best work remains. He is still interested in politics, advocating independence for Cuba and supporting his friend John Hay's ""Open Door"" policy in China. The Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres and The Education of Henry Adams are privately published as companion pieces, representing, in turn, the medieval Christian unity of the thirteenth century and the burgeoning modern multiplicity of the age of science. Adams works to develop his complex ""Dynamic Theory of History,"" discussed in detail in Chapters XXXIII and XXXIV of the Education. The book ends in 1905, seven years before Adams's partially paralyzing stroke, which leads to his death on March 27, 1918."
The Blithedale Romance,"Miles Coverdale, a young poet, is planning to join the Blithedale community the following day. He has come from seeing the Veiled Lady, a popular phenomenon and mesmerist. He encounters Mr. Moodie, an elderly man, who mysteriously asks about his plans and if he knows Zenobia, one of the women going to the community. Coverdale heads out on a wintry April day with Silas Foster and his wife. Zenobia enters, and he is struck by her beauty and wildness. She always wears an exotic flower in her hair. That evening the women prepare food and the men talk of the labor they will engage in. Zenobia and Coverdale discuss Hollingsworth, a man who is to join their society and is singularly devoted to his philanthropic cause of reforming criminals. Hollingsworth finally arrives, with a young and pale girl in tow. She stares obsessively at Zenobia, but no one knows who she is; an old man simply dropped her off. Zenobia seems annoyed by the girl's affection, and lightly mocks her to Coverdale, but decides to be nice to her. Coverdale catches a cold and spends the next few weeks convalescing. Hollingsworth takes care of him lovingly, but the two men disagree about the theories of Charles Fourier and their relation to the community. Coverdale thinks often of Zenobia and her secrets. As Coverdale starts to feel better, he joins his companions. Priscilla is less pale and unhappy, and has blossomed. Others have joined Blithedale in the interim and Coverdale wonders if the focus is too much on labor and the land. He also notices how close Hollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla are. Rumors fly around the community about Hollingsworth and Zenobia, speculating as to whether they attached to each other. Moodie comes to visit, and reveals that he is Priscilla's father. He talks with Hollingsworth and Coverdale, and asks if Zenobia is kind to Priscilla. When he hears she is, he is very happy. Coverdale walks a distance away from the farm, and meets a strange man in the woods named Professor Westervelt, who annoys him with his insouciance and asks after Zenobia and Priscilla. He later sees Zenobia and Westervelt walking in the woods, and infers that they have some sort of connection, and that she hates him. Coverdale hears him advise to get rid of Priscilla. The community engages in readings and performances often, and one night Zenobia relates the tale of the Veiled Lady. Her tale captivates the group, but becomes too real when she surprised everyone by throwing a piece of fabric on Priscilla. Coverdale and his three companions also often spend time at a rock named Eliot's Pulpit, where Coverdale is prone to orations. Hollingsworth and Zenobia debate women's rights; Pricilla agrees with Hollingsworth and to Coverdale's surprise Zenobia seems to as well. He sees her and Hollingsworth exchange a gesture. Later Coverdale and Hollingsworth have a falling out since Coverdale will not join with the other man in using the farm's land for his philanthropic plan. Coverdale decides to leave Blithedale for a time. He takes a room at a Boston hotel and amuses himself by watching the boarding house denizens across the way. One day he realizes he is looking into a room that contains Zenobia, Priscilla, and Westervelt. Zenobia sees him and lowers the curtain with scorn. Coverdale is offended but decides he must call on them. Zenobia receives him, and their exchange makes Coverdale realizes she loves Hollingsworth. Coverdale asks to see Priscilla and she is brought out. It is clear she has no free will. Zenobia says the group has an engagement and they leave. Coverdale decides to find out more by talking to Moodie. He buys the man a drink and encourages him to talk. The old man speaks of his former life as Fauntleroy, and how he had two families; thus, Zenobia and Priscilla were half sisters. Priscilla knew of her older sister and idolized her. Zenobia grew up in her uncle's wealth but did not know her origins. People connected her to a handsome man and spread rumors. Coverdale is surprised by his findings. He attends a lyceum performance of the Veiled Lady, controlled by none other than Westervelt. Hollingsworth, who is also there, ascends the stage and calls out to the Lady, who turns out to be Priscilla. She leaves, now free, with Hollingsworth. Eventually Coverdale returns to Blithedale, but his journey is strange and the farm is quiet. He comes across revelers in the woods, and fleeing, stumbles upon Hollingsworth, Priscilla, and Zenobia. Something has happened -Hollingsworth and Zenobia are no longer friends. Zenobia excoriates him, and he leaves with Priscilla, who, despite her love for her sister, loves Hollingsworth too fiercely. Alone with Coverdale, Zenobia collapses in tears. She tells him she will leave Blithedale, and gives him her flower. Giving him her cold hand, she announces she will go to a nunnery. Coverdale is overwhelmed and falls asleep. Upon waking at midnight, he has a presentiment and goes to Hollingsworth and Silas Foster. None have seen Zenobia, and Coverdale is confident something has happened. They head to the river and eventually find the drowned woman's body. Zenobia is buried on the hillside. Westervelt is there, and he and Coverdale argue over whether Zenobia had reason to kill herself. Coverdale secretly agrees with him that it was a waste for her to do that merely for love. Years later Coverdale visits Hollingsworth and Priscilla. The former has had little success in his reform endeavors, and the latter is unhappy. As for Coverdale, he remains a bachelor, albeit a financially secure one. He confesses that he loved Priscilla."
Anthem,"Ever since Equality 7-2521 was a child, he has been more physically and mentally vigorous than his classmates, but his collectivist society has taught him that to be different is a sin. He tries unsuccessfully to suppress his curiosity, and for his crime of preference in desiring a position with the wise Scholars, the Council of Vocations assigns him a job as a Street Sweeper. For four years, Equality 7-2521 tries to acquit himself admirably in his vocation and to follow the rigid schedule of his life, but one day, he and International 4-8818 discover a secret tunnel from the Unmentionable Times before the Great Rebirth. International 4-8818 is too afraid to explore, but he is a loyal friend and does not betray Equality 7-2521, who begins to sneak away to conduct scientific experiments in the tunnel. Equality 7-2521 keeps a journal describing his experiences. This in turn forms the book's narrative. Significantly, Equality 7-2521 speaks always as ""we"" rather than ""I"", because his society does not have singular pronouns. He desires forgiveness for keeping the tunnel to himself and for thinking the thoughts of an individual rather than of the collective. One day, as Equality 7-2521 is working in a Street Sweeper's brigade north of the city, he sees and is immediately attracted to the beautiful and proud Liberty 5-3000 among the Peasants. She also notices him, and they greet each other with subtle gestures. Eventually Equality 7-2521 finds an opportunity to speak with Liberty 5-3000 privately, knowing that International 4-8818 will not betray his contact with her. He has privately named her the Golden One, although such a unique name is a sin, and the two clumsily express preference for each other, despite their lack of a sufficient vocabulary to do so. Equality 7-2521 returns home happily, and upon being reprimanded for singing, he reflects on the fear and unhappiness of his coworkers while wondering about the Unmentionable Times and the Unspeakable Word, for which the Transgressor, a heroic man, had been executed at the stake. After some time, Equality 7-2521 again speaks with the Golden One in the field. She has named him the Unconquered, although this act of individualization is forbidden, and she expresses a willingness to obey him. She brings him water to drink, and the contact between her hands and his lips spurs a new feeling of desire in Equality 7-2521. This confuses him, as he has previously only experienced sex through the indignities of the Palace of Mating. During Equality 7-2521's private experiments in the tunnel, he rediscovers electricity, which is remarkable in a society that has lost all technology except for the candle, and he realizes that the Council of Scholars may not be as wise and omniscient as he had previously believed. He also concludes from the contents of the tunnel that the men of the Unmentionable Times had also known about electricity, and he decides to continue experimentation, ignoring his worries about breaking the law and finally succeeding in constructing a glass box that emits electric light. He begins to take pride in his own body and his accomplishments, and he decides that he will bring his invention to the upcoming World Council of Scholars, in the hope that it may help his fellow man, exonerate him for his crimes, and thereby allow him to rejoin society. The day that Equality 7-2521 creates the glass box, he loses track of time and is caught for his absence and sent to the Palace of Corrective Detention for torture. However, he refuses to tell the Judges about his whereabouts in order to protect the light. The day before the meeting of the Council of Scholars, he escapes because the locks are rusted and the doors have no guards. He brings his creation to the Council, but rather than rewarding him for his ingenuity, they fear him and his creation and decide to destroy the glass box. To protect his creation, he takes it and escapes blindly through the window into the Uncharted Forest at the edge of the City, realizing in the process that he had actually built the box for himself and not to benefit society. In spite of his initial despair at his sundering from his community, Equality 7-2521 thoroughly enjoys his first day of true freedom in the Uncharted Forest, reveling in his own strength and ability. In a stream, he sees his reflection for the first time, and he is delighted to see that the beauty of his body matches the worthiness of his mind. To his delight, the Golden One follows him into the Forest, despite her misgivings about being damned, and he teaches her not to suspect corruption in solitude as they have been taught. They begin traveling away from the city, sustaining themselves through the efforts of their bodies. Equality 7-2521 is joyful, and wonders how humanity's thoughts about morality have gone so wrong. At the same time, he and the Golden One wonder about the Unspeakable Word, without which they cannot truly express their love for each other. Upon exiting the forest, Equality 7-2521 and the Golden One travel across mountains and find a house built in the Unspeakable Times, where they decide to make their home. They are surprised to find that the structure housed only two people, and the Golden One is fascinated by her reflection in the mirrors, while Equality 7-2521 wonders what his heart and nature are trying to tell him as he struggles through the vestiges of his old belief in collectivism. He reads the books in the house's library and discovers that the Unspeakable Word must be ""I,"" representing the concept of the centrality of self that collectivism has removed from the culture. Triumphantly, Equality 7-2521 explains in his journal that he needs no reason to exist except for himself, and that the error of collectivism was to assume that extreme altruism would free instead of enslave the individual. Only through egoism and the rejection of the worship of ""We"" can man achieve happiness and pride in his work, and friendship is earned rather than automatically forced on all men. Equality 7-2521 renames himself Prometheus and his wife Gaea, and he plans to raise his son as a free man and to return to the City briefly to gather like-minded men such as International 4-8818. He also decides to rebuild what the Great Rebirth destroyed from the Unmentionable Times, knowing that the power of the individual will ultimately achieve victory over the oppression and stagnation of the group."
The Importance of Being Earnest,"Welcome to Wilde's wild world. Things move fast here, so be prepared to catch all the banter. Ready? Algernon Moncrieff welcomes his friend Ernest Worthing in for a visit. Through an incident with a cigarette case and an unlucky inscription, Ernest is forced to confess that his name is really Jack. The story goes like this: in the country, Jack must lead the boring life of responsible guardian for his pretty, young ward Cecily. So he made up a seedy younger brother named Ernest, who is an urban socialite.Cecily, we learn, is a bit too interested in Ernest for her own good. Whenever Jack feels like it, he visits London on the pretense that he's cleaning up Ernest's messes. After all, as the older brother he must be responsible for getting his younger brother out of trouble. Instead, Jack takes on the name Ernest and goes partying around town. Algernon is amused by this discovery and reveals that he has a similar nonexistent friend. Algernon's friend is a perpetual invalid named Bunbury, who allows Algernon to visit the country whenever he likes. We learn that Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, who is Algernon's cousin and coincidentally scheduled to visit that day. Jack cuts a deal with Algernon: if Algernon can get Gwendolen's mother, Lady Bracknell, out of the room, then Jack can propose to Gwendolen. In return, Jack will dine with Algernon tonight so that Algernon can avoid dining with his Aunt Augusta .The plan works. We learn that Gwendolen is smitten by the name Ernest. She is just accepting Ernest's proposal when Lady Bracknell re-enters the room, discovers them, and furiously sends Gwendolen down to the carriage. Lady Bracknell gives Ernest a chance to prove his worthiness by interviewing him. Once she decides that he is not fit for her daughter, she makes it clear that Gwendolen is not engaged to Ernest. Although Ernest is rich, has a good reputation around town, and seems to be perfectly suitable for Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell doesn't approve of the engagement because of one thing: he's an orphan, abandoned at birth for unknown reasons and found in a handbag at Victoria train station. This doesn't fly with Lady Bracknell, who tells him to find his parents ASAP and then dismisses him. Furious, Jack and Algernon concoct a scheme for getting rid of Ernest. They decide that he'll die in Paris of a severe chill.In the meantime, Gwendolen has found an opportunity to slip back into the room and confess her undying love for Ernest. Having heard her mother's furious remarks, she's fascinated about his mysterious background and asks for his country address. As Ernest gives it, Algernon discreetly copies it down and later announces to his servant that he's going Bunburying tomorrow.At Jack's country estate, young Cecily does everything she can to avoid studying her German grammar. She lies to get her governess, Miss Prism, to take a break. Miss Prism allows this only because she's distracted by Dr. Chasuble, the local reverend. Just as Miss Prism leaves, the arrival of Ernest Worthing is announced. It turns out to be Algernon. Algernon and Cecily flirt outrageously. Cecily reveals that she's been fantasizing about Earnest for quite some time, and has even imagined that she's engaged to him. She invites him in for dinner. At that moment, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return from their walk, only to meet Jack dressed in black mourning clothes. He's come home early to announce that his brother, Ernest, has died tragically in Paris, of a severe chill.Right on cue, Cecily comes out to tell her Uncle Jack that Ernest has come to visit. When Jack sees it's Algernon, he is furious and arranges for Ernest to leave via the dog-cart. When the cart comes, Algernon promptly sends it away. Cecily pays Algernon a visit and they engage in more flirtation, where we learn that Cecily is obsessed with the name ""Ernest."" When Algernon leaves , Gwendolen arrives. Cecily entertains her. When each lady learns that the other is supposedly engaged to Ernest Worthing, they immediately start fighting. Luckily, both Jack and Algernon show up in time to clear up any doubt. Their true identities are revealed, as well as the fact that there is no Ernest. The women, realizing they've been tricked, suddenly become as close as sisters and go up to the house arm-in-arm, turning their backs on the men. Meanwhile, the men take out their frustration on the remaining tea items, fighting over the muffins while they figure out what to do.Eventually, they enter the house and confess to the women. The Ernest business, they say, was done only so that they could see their beloved ladies as often as possible. The women forgive them. But their joy is interrupted by the arrival of Lady Bracknell. She has come to bring Gwendolen home. When she sees Cecily holding Algernon's hand, she gives her an icy glare, but politely asks Jack how big this girl's inheritance is. When she finds out that the girl is extremely wealthy, Lady Bracknell's attitude toward Cecily changes and she gives consent for her and Algernon to marry. But Jack, as Cecily's guardian, refuses to give his consent unless Lady Bracknell allows him to marry Gwendolen. Lady Bracknell wants nothing to do with it.Dr. Chasuble shows up to tell Jack and Algernon that everything is ready for their baptisms and happens to mention Miss Prism. Lady Bracknell's ears prick up at the name. Miss Prism is brought before her and shamefacedly confesses the truth: she was once Lady Bracknell's servant and was in charge of a certain child. One day, she took the baby out in his stroller for a walk and brought along some leisure reading--a three-volume novel that she had written and kept in a handbag. Distracted, she switched the two--putting the novel in the stroller and the baby into the handbag. She dropped the handbag off at Victoria train station.At this discovery, Jack freaks out and runs upstairs to find something. When he comes back down, he's holding the handbag . Jack mistakenly thinks Miss Prism is his mother, but is corrected by Lady Bracknell, who tells him that a Mrs. Moncrieff is his mother. That makes Jack Algernon's older brother.Then, they all wonder what Jack's real name is. Remember, Gwendolen will only love him if his name is Ernest. Lady Bracknell tells Jack he was named after his father, but nobody can remember what the General's name was. Jack looks up ""Moncrieff"" in his book of Army Lists. The results? His father's name was Ernest. So he's been telling the truth all along. His name really is Ernest. And now he can marry Gwendolen. There's general rejoicing. Gwendolen hugs Ernest. Cecily hugs Algernon. Miss Prism hugs Dr. Chasuble. And Ernest closes the play by insisting that he's now learned the ""importance of being earnest."""
The Ambassadors,"Strether arrives in England and meets up with a frenemy named Waymarsh. But first, he also runs into a woman named Maria Gostrey, who decides to show him around the town. And a middle-aged American with a blah life can't say nay to attention from a younger woman. It turns out that Strether has been sent on a mission by his rich fiancee, Mrs. Newsome, to track down her son Chad and bring him home to run the family business. Strether can't refuse, because Mrs. Newsome is sort of his sugar mama . The Newsome family is convinced that Chad is living an immoral life in Paris, boozing every night and carousing with different women--or worse yet, one woman who's got her claws in him. When Strether finally runs into Chad, though, he's bowled over by how much of a charmer the little brat has become since moving to Europe. In fact, Chad is so cool that he makes the middle-aged Strether wonder if he himself hasn't let life pass him by back in the States. Strether's enjoying the Paris life way more than he'd anticipated, so he starts making up excuses to delay his trip home. Cue the lady drama. Strether meets Marie de Vionnet, a woman Chad hangs out with a lot. But is Chad attracted to the ten-years-older Ms. Vionnet or to her daughter Jeanne? After some inquiries, Strether finds no evidence of any romance with either lady, and it dawns on him that Chad's life isn't immoral at all. If anything, he's just plain ole better than the folks living back in Woollett, Massachusetts. Eventually, the Newsomes get impatient with Strether's delays. So Mrs. Newsome sends her daughter Sarah to see what the holdup is . Strether crosses his fingers that Sarah will be as impressed by Chad's transformation as he's been. Any guesses whether that's the case? Nope. Sarah thinks any possible changes that could happen to people away from the Newsome family are automatically bad changes. And that's that. So she gives Strether a choice: come back to America with Chad immediately, or don't come back at all. Strether decides not to come back at all, effectively breaking his engagement to Mrs. Newsome. And so it looks like everything will be good for Strether in Paris. Which means one thing: here comes more drama! One day he's walking through the French countryside and sees Chad and Madame de Vionnet approaching a rural inn. Lightbulb! Those two ain't so innocent after all. After he realizes that the two of them have a sexual relationship, he has to confront the fact that sex and the deception that goes along with it have been a part of what he's enjoyed about Paris so much. He's just been lying to himself that it was all a good, wholesome pleasure. At the end of the book, Strether decides that he can't change who he is, so he's going to head back to the U. S. of A. He knows there's no place for him back with the Newsomes, but hey, they're part of the problem so that's a-okay. Before he leaves, he sees Maria Gostrey one last time. She begs him to stay with her, but he's through with Europe. Buh-bye!"
The Taming of the Shrew,"The Taming of the Shrew is in fact a play within a play. The larger framework involves a drunkard named Christopher Sly, who stumbles out of an inn and falls into a deep sleep. A Lord passing by notices Sly and decides to play a trick on him. Sly is carried to the Lord's bedchamber and decked in lavish attire. When he awakes, the Lord's attendants refer to him as to a nobleman. The Lord's Page plays the part of the wife, overjoyed to see that her husband has finally recovered from a dire fifteen-year illness due to which he had been under the impression he was a beggar. A troupe of actors have stopped at the Lord's house to put on a performance, and they unwittingly become part of the ruse as well. Sly, after some protest, decides he must indeed be a lord, and watches the show as if it were performed in his honor. So begins the play proper. Lucentio, son of a wealthy Pisan named Vincentio, has arrived in the university town of Padua to pursue his education. His dreams of virtuous enlightenment fall by the wayside, however, when he lays eyes on Bianca, the younger daughter of the well-off Baptista. Bianca has two suitors - the young Hortensio and an old fool named Gremio. Baptista has ordained that he will not give his child away to marriage until her elder sister is wed. The problem is, that sister is Katharina, an ill-tempered, feisty, and quarrelsome ""shrew."" All hope seems lost for Hortensio and Gremio until Petruchio, a gentleman of Verona, arrives on the scene. When Hortensio mentions Katharina - and adds that her father is quite wealthy - Petruchio immediately declares his interest in making her his wife. Lucentio, in the meantime, has devised a plan with his servant, Tranio. Since Baptista is looking for schoolmasters to instruct Bianca, Lucentio disguises himself as Cambio, a Latin teacher, while Tranio plays the role of the master. Hortensio gets the same idea and dresses himself up as a music teacher named Litio in order to access Bianca. Thus the wooers descend on the Baptista household. Tranio, in his noble guise, becomes another official suitor for Bianca's hand, while ""Cambio"" and ""Litio"" embed themselves inside. Petruchio, for his part, eagerly awaits the arrival of Katharina; the stories of her shrewishness only further his excitement. When she does finally appear, the two would-be lovers engage in a furious battle of wits. When Baptista, Tranio, and Gremio enter, Petruchio delightedly informs them that he and Katharina are to be wed on Sunday, despite her protestations. As soon as it appears that Katharina will be married, Baptista turns to Bianca's suitors, asking which of them could provide the richest dowry. Tranio guarantees more than Gremio is able, but Baptista insists upon receiving Vincentio's assurance that the money will be paid. Tranio hatches a plan to feign the assurance by dressing someone up as Vincentio. In the meantime, Lucentio, while playing the part of a Latin instructor, is able to declare his passion for Bianca. She is more partial to him than to ""Litio,"" whose advances she dismisses. Katharina and Petruchio's wedding proceeds hastily and wildly. Petruchio behaves like a tyrant during the service and then refuses even to let Katharina stay for the wedding feast, instead sweeping her away to his home in the country. There, Petruchio plays the part of an odious master. He refuses to help Katharina when she falls from her horse, beats and berates his servants, and denies his wife food and sleep. He reveals his plan to starve Katharina into submission - to out-shrew her as it were - all under the guise of kindness and love. Back at Baptista's, Tranio, witnessing the flirtation between Lucentio and Bianca, persuades Hortensio to call off his wooing of her. The two men vow never to court her again, and Hortensio declares that he will wed a wealthy widow instead. Tranio communicates the good news to the lovers, and then proceeds to solve the problem of Vincentio's assurance. Finding a traveling Pedant from Mantua, he convinces the old man that all Mantuans in Padua are to be put to death, and suggests that the Pedant disguise himself as the Pisan Vincentio. The Pedant readily agrees and assures Baptista that Bianca will receive a sufficient dower. Baptista is satisfied and allows the wedding. Meanwhile, at Petruchio's house, Katharina emerges as polite and gracious in comparison to her husband. After insulting a Haberdasher and Tailor who have come to present their wears, Petruchio sets off with his wife to Padua. They come across the real Vincentio, who is shocked to hear that his son Lucentio has married Bianca. The party arrives in Padua just after Lucentio and Bianca have stolen away to the church. In Padua, Vincentio confronts the Pedant who is impersonating him. Finally, Lucentio, returning from the church, pleads for his father's forgiveness. Vincentio, still fuming, grants his assurance to Baptista and the marriage between Lucentio and Bianca is settled. In the final scene of the play, the newlyweds all gather at Lucentio's house. The men propose a wager to see which of their three wives - Kate, Bianca or the Widow - is most obedient to her husband. Both Lucentio and Hortensio summon their wives only to be snubbed. Katharina, however, comes at Petruchio's beckoning. The ""veriest shrew,"" in Baptista's words , thus emerges as the most obedient wife of all. Katharina delivers a speech detailing a wife's duty to her husband, and so the play ends."
Batman Returns,"In the prologue, Gotham City socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot give birth to a deformed baby boy, Oswald. Disgusted by his appearance and wild demeanor, they confine the baby to a cage and ultimately throw him into the sewer, where he is discovered by a family of penguins underneath the abandoned zoo. Thirty-three years later, millionaire and philanthropist Max Shreck proposes to build a power plant to supply Gotham with energy, though he is opposed by the mayor. During Shreck's speech, Gotham comes under attack by a disgraced former circus troupe, the Red Triangle Gang. Though Batman intervenes and manages to fight the criminals off, Shreck is abducted and taken to the sewer, where he meets the gang's secret leader, Oswald himself, now going by the name ""Penguin"". Oswald blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corporate crimes into helping him return to the surface, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers that the power plant is actually meant to drain Gotham of its energy, which will bring the city under Shreck's control. Shreck pushes her out of a window to silence her, but she survives the fall and vows revenge, taking up the mantle of Catwoman. Oswald makes his presence known by rescuing the mayor's baby from a staged kidnapping attempt, and requests to be allowed into the Hall of Records to find his parents. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, voices his suspicions about Oswald's true motives, and investigates his background and connection to the Red Triangle Gang, discovering that the troupe had been shut down years ago due to children going missing during their performances and the disappearance of one specific member before interrogation, who Bruce suspects to be Oswald. During a meeting with Shreck to voice his own opposition to the power plant, Bruce meets Selina and the two become attracted to one another. In order to remove his enemies, Shreck pushes for Oswald to run for mayor and discredit the current mayor by having the Red Triangle Gang wreak havoc on the city. Batman intervenes and meets Catwoman as she attempts to sabotage one of Shreck's businesses; she escapes, but is injured and swears revenge on Batman by allying with Oswald, who also plans to kill Batman as part of his own schemes. As Bruce and Selina begin a romantic relationship, Oswald abducts Gotham's Ice Princess and kills her, framing Batman for the act, as well as causing the Batmobile to rampage throughout Gotham before Batman narrowly manages to regain control and escape the authorities. When Catwoman rejects his advances, Oswald breaks off their partnership and attempts to kill her, but she survives after falling into a greenhouse. During the chase, Batman records Oswald's disparaging remarks about the people of Gotham and later plays them during his next speech, destroying his image and forcing him to return to the sewer, where he renounces his humanity and reveals his plan to abduct and kill all of Gotham's firstborn sons as revenge for what his parents did to him. At a charity ball hosted by Shreck, Bruce and Selina meet and discover each other's secret identities. The Penguin appears and reveals his plan, intending to take Shreck's son Chip with him, but Shreck gives himself up in his son's stead. Batman foils the kidnappings and heads for the Penguin's lair. The Penguin attempts to have his army of penguins bomb the city and kill everyone in Gotham, though Batman and his butler, Alfred, jam the signal and order the penguins to return to the sewer. Batman arrives and confronts the Penguin. In the ensuing fight, the Penguin falls through a window into the sewer's toxic water. Shreck escapes but is confronted by Catwoman, who intends to kill him. Batman pleads for Selina to stop, unmasking himself in the process. Shreck draws a gun and shoots Bruce, and then shoots Selina multiple times, but she survives and electrocutes herself and Shreck with a stun gun, causing a massive explosion. Bruce, who was wearing body armor, finds Shreck's remains but Selina is nowhere to be found. The Penguin emerges from the water and tries to shoot Bruce from behind, but eventually dies from his injuries and from the toxic sewage, before his penguin family lays his body to rest in the water. In the aftermath, as Alfred drives him home, Bruce sees Selina's silhouette in an alley but only finds her cat as a farewell gift, who he decides to take home with him. The Bat-Signal appears in the sky as Catwoman, who survived, watches."
Bloodmoon,"At a local gym in New York City, heavyweight boxing champion Eddie Cunningham is finishing his workout for the night. He hears a noise and looks around when he turns to the ring. A mysterious man dressed in black sporting a mask tells Eddie he fights well but he lacks the ""killer instinct"". The masked man challenges the boxer to a fight and shows him the moon, which has a faint red color. The man sports boots with the toes and heels encased in steel and uses martial arts to fight Eddie. Initially, the two combatants seemed evenly matched, but Eddie soon finds himself overwhelmed by the man's superior fighting skills. When the man knocks Eddie outside of the ring, he unmasks himself and still pounds on Eddie despite Eddie's pleas of calling off the fight. When Eddie uses a bench to knock down the man, the man uses two steel fingers which goes through the bench and stabs Eddie in the chest. He hoists a dead Eddie in the air and declares victory. The next day, Detective Chuck Baker, a wise cracking cop who has a penchant for magic, is called to investigate Eddie's death. This is the fourth death of a recent wave of a possible connected killing spree in New York City. When Chuck returns to the office, his making fun of Chief Hutchins gets him in hot water with the chief, who tells him that if he doesn't solve the case, he will have him transferred to Poughkeepsie. That night, former toughman champion Dutch is on a date at his bar. His date hears a noise during their makeout session and he tries to calm her down to no avail. However, the masked man appears with the girl and calls Dutch ""Crutch"". He chokes the girl unconscious and he and Dutch fight. At first, Dutch seems to have the upper hand before the masked man reveals his true skills. When he cripples Dutch, he unmasks himself and it seems Dutch knows him, when he responds, ""You?"" Dutch's last ditch attempt to stop the man results in the killer breaking his neck and throwing him out of the bar window. The next day, at an autopsy clinic, Chuck analyzes Dutch's body and Chief Hutchins tells Chuck that he would like for him to meet with a serial killer expert named Ken O'Hara. Ken was one of the best in Chief Hutchins' unit until he was forced into retirement due to a near fatal experience with his last job. Ken, who is separated from his wife, is spending the day with his daughter at the beach. As they are about to leave, Ken accidentally bumps into a big fat guy, causing him to spill his beer on his shirt. Ken apologizes and offers to pay for his shirt and beer. The big guy felt offended and wants to start a fight with Ken. Ken initially refuses to fight, but when the big guy does harm to Ken's daughter by pushing her out of the way despite her pleads for him to not harm Ken, Ken becomes enraged and fights the big guy and his two goons. He ends up knocking all three of them down. Ken shows up at the house where he sees his ex-wife and Chuck. Mistaking Chuck for a lover of his ex's, Chuck tells him that Chief Hutchins sent him and asks for help in the case. At first Ken refuses and even has a flashback of his last job. That night, Chuck finds a fellow police officer watching a ""movie"" on the computer screen. Chuck learns the video is a real-time confrontation between the mysterious killer, now decked out in full kendo gear, and local martial arts master Takaido. Chuck heads towards Takaido's school while the killer and Takaido have a sword fight. When Takaido unmasks the killer, he recognizes him as well through a nod. However, the killer proves to be too much as the killer slices and stabs Takaido. When Chuck arrives, the entrance to the school explodes but Chuck makes it out okay. When Ken learns that Takaido, his martial arts instructor, has been killed, he sneaks into the school late at night but also catches Chuck at the school. After a brief fight, the two look at each other and Chuck is shocked to find Ken. Kelly, Takaido's adopted daughter, finds the two and stops them from fighting. Ken agrees to help Chuck on the case. At first, Chuck is reluctant for Ken's help, but soon finds him a valuable ally due to Ken's connections, including a computer hacker named Justice. However, when Justice attempts to trace the killer's latest call, the killer forces Chuck and Ken to confront and take down a local crime boss and his goons. Ken and Chuck soon learn that Kelly is about to be the killer's next target. When the two arrive at Kelly's apartment, they warn her of the killer's intentions, but Kelly dismisses them, claiming she can take care of herself. As they leave, the killer arrives and Kelly finds him, leading to a confrontation. Ken and Chuck return to retrieve a file Ken accidentally left at the apartment only to find themselves facing the killer, who was overpowering Kelly. Chuck, Ken and Kelly prove to be too much for the killer, who after knocking out Kelly and using his steel fingers to incapacitate Ken, escapes by jumping out of a window onto a garbage truck. Ken and Chuck, along with Kelly, decide to locate the killer, whose targets are clearly champions in various fighting styles. They find a photo of combatants in a tournament known as The Master's Challenge and they narrow the field down to two suspects, Willy and Chad. Chad was believed to have been killed in a car accident, thus making Willy the prime suspect. However, the killer is in fact Chad, who did have an accident, which resulted in him losing two fingers, which he replaced with steel. Kelly discovers the killer amongst a crowd watching the police leave to apprehend Willy and follows him to his home. Kelly confronts the killer only to end up defeated. Chuck and Ken succeed in capturing Willy, but they noticed during the confrontation that something was not right in terms of Willy's appearance, fighting style and skills in comparison to those of the person they fought earlier. Their suspicions are confirmed when Kelly texts them what she'd discovered. They rush to the killer's house, only to arrive too late finding Kelly's lifeless body and the killer nowhere to be found. The killer then phones Ken, revealing that he has kidnapped Ken's wife and daughter in order to challenge Ken to a ""grand championship match"" to the death. Ken and Chuck head to an abandoned construction site where the top of the building has Ken's wife (whom he has reconciled) and daughter strapped to a bomb. As Ken begins to face off against the killer in a showdown, the killer uses the environment to his advantage. When Chuck attempts to help Ken, Chuck is nearly killed for his actions. However, Ken eventually gets the upper hands and on a long scaffold, Ken unleashes a flurry of kicks and blows, knocking the killer off the building and causing him to fall to his death. When Ken reaches his wife and daughter, the bomb goes off but the explosion only consists of confetti. A tape recording reveals the killer saying, ""I'm no child killer. There will be no slaughter of the innocents"". Chuck makes it out, still injured from the killer, while Ken walks away in joy and relief with his wife and daughter."
Snowpiercer,"The film is set in the year 2031, 17 years after an attempt to stop climate change via stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfired and created a new ice age and caused ecocide. The remnants of humanity have taken to a self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards. Urged by his mentor, Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt after they realize the guards' weapons have no ammunition; bullets are believed to be ""extinct"" after being exhausted in a previous revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist, and use a drug known as Kronole made from industrial waste as bribery in exchange for his assistance. Namgoong insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed as well. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress forward, but they find themselves facing a carful of guards armed with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. During the battle, the train goes into a tunnel, causing total darkness. The guard force, equipped with night vision, begins picking off the blind rebels. However, the tail-sectioners launch a counterattack with torches and push the guards back. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis sacrifices him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is fatally stabbed. The tail mob stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who have had their children taken from them) toward the front of the train. Curtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and consider that the ice may be thawing. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to celebrate the eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. The bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with loaded automatic guns hidden under the eggs, revealing that bullets still exist. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to execute Mason in turn. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong. The two, along with Yona, continue onward. In the last car before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the drug Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can now survive outside. Curtis stops them, as he wants to meet Wilford; Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, 17 years before, the tail section had resorted to cannibalism, and he had been ready to eat the infant Edgar but Gilliam offered him his arm instead. Curtis wants to face Wilford to ask why he created this closed ecosystem. The engine door opens, and Wilford's assistant Claude emerges and wounds Namgoong before inviting Curtis inside. Curtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. Wilford orders 74% of the tail passengers killed. He then offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept as Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and asks for matches. In desperation she pulls open a floorboard, with Curtis' help, to reveal Tanya's son, Timmy, working the engine as a machine part, taken from his mother to be a slave. Appalled, Curtis knocks out Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Curtis gives Yona matches to light the fuse for the Kronole bomb, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who had followed them, along with partygoers from another car. Andy, Andrew's missing son, crawls out of a nook and is unresponsive to Curtis' begging as he climbs into the engine. As the door to the engine room was damaged during the fighting and will not close, Curtis and Namgoong use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast. The explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. With Curtis and Namgoong unresponsive, Yona escapes the wreckage with Timmy. They see a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train."
The Bourne Ultimatum,"Following his pursuit by Kirill, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) eludes Moscow police while wounded through a train station and deals with more flashbacks of when he first joined Operation Treadstone. Six weeks later, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn). Meanwhile, in Turin, journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to London, after his mention of ""Blackbriar"" during a cell phone call to his editor is detected by the ECHELON system. Bourne reappears in Paris to inform Martin Kreutz (Daniel Brühl), the brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), of her assassination in India, also in the previous film. Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when he panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Ross is shot and killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz (Édgar Ramírez) on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels' office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit. Nicky learns that Blackbriar ""asset"" Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Nicky accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Nicky and Bourne as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Bourne follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels's death by a planted bomb. However, Bourne manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Nicky. After sending Nicky into hiding, Bourne examines the contents of Daniels' briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in New York City, where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Bourne travels to New York. Landy receives a phone call from Bourne, which is intercepted by Vosen. When Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and gives him the birth date ""4-15-71"", Bourne tells Landy to ""get some rest"" because she looks tired, tipping off that he is in New York and watching her from an overlooking building. Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne of a location to meet up, and leaves his office with a tactical team. Bourne, however, waits for them all to leave, enters Vosen's office, and takes classified Blackbriar documents. When he realizes that he has been tricked, Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, but the resulting car chase ends with Bourne forcing Paz's car to crash into a concrete barrier. Bourne holds the injured Paz at gunpoint, but spares his life. Bourne arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne on an upper floor, who now remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, ""Why didn't you take the shot?""  Bourne asks Paz if he knows why he's supposed to kill him, and repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River. Some time later, Nicky watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the whereabouts of David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Nicky smiles. Bourne is shown swimming away in the East River."
The Mask of Zorro,"In 1821, masked swordsman Zorro defends the commoners of Las Californias from Spain's soldiers. Don Rafael Montero, Las Californias' corrupt governor, sets a trap for Zorro at the public execution of three peasants. Zorro stops the execution, aided by two young brothers, Alejandro and Joaquín Murrieta. Zorro thanks them by giving Joaquín a medallion. Don Rafael deduces that nobleman Don Diego de la Vega is Zorro and attempts to arrest him at his home. A swordfight begins, a fire breaks out, and de la Vega's wife Esperanza, for whom Montero held an unrequited love, dies as a result. While the mansion burns, Montero takes Esperanza's infant daughter, Elena, as his own before sending Diego to prison and returning to Spain. In 1841, Alejandro and Joaquín are bandits, running a scam to collect the bounty on their heads and steal a strongbox. They, however, are caught by Captain Harrison Love, Montero's new American right-hand man. Alejandro escapes, while Joaquín shoots himself to avoid capture. Meanwhile, Montero returns to California with the now-adult Elena. Because of Montero, Elena believes that her mother died in childbirth and that he is her father. Montero's reappearance motivates Diego to escape captivity. He encounters Alejandro getting drunk and recognizes the medallion. He agrees to make Alejandro his protégé in order for them to battle their respective enemies, Montero and Love. Alejandro agrees to undergo Diego's training regimen in Zorro's secret cave underneath the ruins of his family estate to be able to take revenge. In addition, Alejandro seeks to succeed Diego as Zorro. While still being trained, Alejandro steals a stallion resembling Zorro's steed Tornado from a garrison. Diego scolds Alejandro, asserting that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief or seeker of fame. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust and acquire charm instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, with Diego as his servant ""Bernardo"", and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. There, he earns Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting between noblemen. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons and proclaim it as an independent republic by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money for the upcoming Mexican–American War. Montero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to ""El Dorado"", a secret gold mine where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor. The plan is to buy California from Santa Anna using gold which appears from Spain but is actually mined from his own land. While walking in a market, Elena meets the woman who was her nanny. She tells Elena her parents' real identity. Diego sends Alejandro, now Zorro, to steal Montero's map leading to the gold mine. Zorro duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When he escapes, Elena chases him, attempting to retrieve Montero's map. After a sword duel, Zorro kisses her and flees. Fearing Santa Anna could discover the scheme, Montero decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers. Diego tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so he can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. Diego corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, demanding Elena be brought to them to hear the whole truth. Montero then arrests him. While being taken away, Diego tells Elena the name of the flowers she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her real father. She releases Diego from his cell. They proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and Diego respectively kill Love and Montero, avenging Joaquín and Esperanza. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off and find the mortally wounded Diego. Before dying, he makes peace with the pair and gives his blessings for Alejandro to continue as Zorro and marry Elena. Sometime later, Alejandro and Elena are married and have rebuilt Diego's hacienda. Alejandro tells his infant son Joaquín of Don Diego's deeds as Zorro."
Mission: Impossible,"Jim Phelps and his latest Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team are dispatched to stop the theft of the CIA non-official cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague. Their mission fails: the list is stolen, Phelps is shot, his wife Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except Ethan Hunt are eliminated by unknown assassins and supposed tech malfunctions. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within the IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as ""Max"" as part of ""Job 314."" As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees. Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes ""Job 314"" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, ""Job"" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that she has been given a fake list on a disc equipped with a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Max and her agents escape, taking Hunt with them, just before a CIA team raids their location. Hunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the real list, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having stolen a Bible with a Gideon stamp from Chicago's Drake Hotel during a previous assignment known to Hunt's team. Hunt also suspects Krieger as the one who killed the other IMF members in Prague, having recognized his distinctive knife; however, he is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day and secretly sends tickets to Kittridge. On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and directs Hunt to the baggage car, where he can find both the money and Job. Hunt calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Hunt will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Hunt, since they will need a fall guy, but Phelps reveals himself to be Hunt in a mask, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps' image to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole. Phelps threatens to kill Hunt, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents. Hunt is unsure about returning to the team, but on the flight home, an attendant uses a coded phrase to ask him if he is ready to take on a new mission."
Monkeybone,"Stuart ""Stu"" Miley is a disillusioned cartoonist whose comic character, a rascal monkey named Monkeybone, is getting a cartoon show. Stu plans to propose to Dr. Julie McElroy, a sleep institute worker who helped him deal with his terrible nightmares by changing his drawing hand. One night, Stu crashes his car after accidentally activating an inflatable Monkeybone raft, causing him to fall into a coma. His spirit ends up in Down Town, a surreal, limbo-like carnival landscape populated by human beings, strange figures, mythical creatures and figments of people's imaginations where nightmares are entertainment. In Down Town, Monkeybone is real. During that time, Stu befriends a catgirl named Miss Kitty. When Stu learns that his sister Kimmy is about to pull the plug on him, he asks Hypnos, God of Sleep, for advice. Hypnos tells Stu that to get back to the living, he has to infiltrate the Land of Death to steal an Exit Pass from Death which are given out to coma victims by Reapers giving them permission to leave Down Town and awaken from their coma. Stu successfully steals an Exit Pass, but Monkeybone steals it from him in turn and enters the Land of the Living in Stu's body through the Revive-O as Hypnos states that they have plans for Stu's body. Stu later finds himself locked up in a jail cell with Attila the Hun, Jack the Ripper, and Stephen King, who reveals his nightmare of Cujo pulled the same trick Monkeybone pulled on Stu. Hypnos arrives and explains to Stu that he plans to use Stu's body to get a chemical substance called the ""Oneirix"" that Julie developed that gives people and animals nightmares, which gives him more power. Upon being sent to the institute by Hypnos upon reminding him of his mission, Monkeybone (in Stu's body) ends up successfully stealing the Oneirix, switching it with another juice. Monkeybone obtains the Oneirix and puts it inside stuffed monkey toys of himself so that those who come in contact with them will be infected and given nightmares. With help from Miss Kitty, Stu escapes from his imprisonment. Monkeybone in Stu's body prepares a pinata for the dolls at the party. Meanwhile, Stu reveals Hypnos' plan to Death upon capture and convinces her to send him back for only an hour, only to find himself in the body of a dead athlete organ donor. As he flees the morgue attendants, Stu finds out about Monkeybone's planned party and heads there with the extractors still in pursuit. At the party, Stu's agent, Herb, exposes himself to the Oneirix in the Monkeybone doll and ends up seeing in the mirror that his clothes are coming to life. This causes Herb to run through the party naked, telling everyone that the clothes have come to life and turned evil. Monkeybone shrugs it off as he brings down the Stu piñata containing the Monkeybone dolls. Stu uses Monkeybone's main characteristics from the comics to cause him to panic and escape. A chase ensues, culminating with Stu and Monkeybone battling each other while clinging to a giant Monkeybone balloon. The balloon is eventually shot down by an incompetent police officer and both Stu and Monkeybone plummet into comas. Stu and Monkeybone fall toward Down Town where the residents cheer on their fight. Soon, all the rides stop and a giant robot emerges near the Revive-O causing everyone to flee the area. When Stu and Monkeybone are caught by it, the operator of the robot is revealed to be Death, who seems quite cheerful despite the circumstances. Monkeybone tries to have Death let him go to the bathroom, but Death places Monkeybone back in Stu's head where he belongs. Death then uses her robot to send Stu back to the living. Stu wakes up in his own body, reunites and proposes to Julie. There, an erratic Herb breaks the fourth wall urging the audience to take off their clothes as the film cuts to an animated sequence where cartoon characters strip their human disguises revealing monkeys underneath."

Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"In 1999, spy Austin Powers enjoys his honeymoon with his wife, Vanessa Kensington. She turns out to be a fembot controlled by Austin's nemesis Dr. Evil. She attempts to kill Austin, then self-destructs. Austin grieves briefly before realizing he is single again and thus can have sex without commitment. A NATO monitoring facility observes the return of Dr. Evil, who confronts his son Scott and starts a coup on The Jerry Springer Show. At Dr. Evil's Seattle headquarters, Dr. Evil is presented with a one-eighth-size clone of himself, whom he names Mini-Me. Dr. Evil unveils his latest plan: he has developed a time portal to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin's mojo, the source of his sexual appeal. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me travel to 1969 and meet a younger Number Two and Frau Farbissina. An obese ""Scottish Guard"", Fat Bastard, extracts Austin's mojo from his frozen body at the Ministry of Defence. British intelligence warns Austin that one of Dr. Evil's agents is after him, and during a photo shoot the wanton Ivana Humpalot seduces him, but at the last moment claims he is too sexy to kill.

Austin and Felicity are pursued by Mustafa, another of Dr. Evil's henchmen; when caught he reveals the existence of Dr. Evil's volcano lair. Before he can divulge its location, Mini-Me shoots him with a dart, causing him to fall off a cliff. Examining photographs from the crime scene, Austin identifies Fat Bastard as the perpetrator of the theft of his mojo. At Dr. Evil's lair, Fat Bastard arrives with Austin's mojo.

Dr. Evil and Mini-Me leave for the Moon to install the laser pursued by Austin and Felicity on Apollo 11. In Dr. Evil's moon base, Austin battles with Mini-Me, eventually flushing him into space. As Austin confronts Dr. Evil, Dr. Evil gives him a choice: save the world or Felicity, who is locked in a chamber with poison gas. Felicity tells Austin to save the world and he succeeds, but Felicity dies. Before Austin can kill him, Dr. Evil suggests Austin use the time machine to save both Felicity and the world. Austin travels ten minutes into the past, meeting up with himself and saving the world and Felicity. Dr. Evil initiates the self-destruct mechanism of the moon base and escapes after throwing Austin's mojo into the air. Both Austins fail to catch it and it is destroyed.

Moby Dick,"In 1841, a sailor named Ishmael wanders to the New England town of New Bedford, Massachusetts, to sign on a whaling ship. In the inn where he is staying for the night, he is forced to share his room with a Pacific Islander and harponeer named Queequeg, whom he befriends after a tense first meeting. The next morning, the two of them hire onto a whaling ship named Pequod, which is commanded by grim Captain Ahab, who is obsessed with hunting and killing a legendary white-skinned whale named Moby Dick, who was responsible for severing Ahab's left leg. Just before their departure, Ishmael and Queequeg encounter a man named Elijah, who delivers an ominous warning about Ahab and that all but one of the crew who follow him will find their deaths on this voyage. As the ship casts off, and for some time afterwards, Ahab remains unseen until he finally appears to align his crew to the hunt for Moby Dick and sets course for the Bikini Atoll, where the whale is said to dwell. While the crew reaps a fair bounty of oil on their journey, Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick remains foremost in his mind. When the captain of a passing ship, who recently lost his hand to the white whale, informs Ahab of Moby Dick's latest whereabouts near the coast of Madagascar, Ahab immediately breaks off a particularly successful hunt, unsettling his crew, particularly his chief mate Starbuck. Starbuck suggests to his fellow officers Stubb and Flask to wrest command of the Pequod from Ahab, which the two refuse. As the Pequod nears the atoll, a man falls from the ship's mast into the sea and disappears. Right afterwards, the Pequod is stuck in slack water for days. Casting bones to read his future, Queequeg foresees his death and orders the ship's carpenter to make him a coffin, before he sits down to await his demise. When one of the crew prepares to cut Queequeg's skin for fun, Ishmael rises to his friend's defense, prompting Queequeg to break his death reverie and defend Ishmael. Just then, Moby Dick briefly appears before the ship and escapes before the Pequod crew can attack him. After rowing the ship out of the becalmed area, Ahab resumes the hunt. They encounter the Rachel, another whaler from New Bedford, whose captain, Gardiner, asks Ahab to help search for his son, who was carried off by Moby Dick. Ahab refuses his aid and departs. When the Pequod hits a typhoon, Ahab uses the gale to speed the chase, endangering the ship. Starbuck decides to depose Ahab by force, but relents when in a rare humane moment Ahab reminisces about his self-destructive obsession for revenge. Right after this conversation, a strange omen portends the fulfillment of Elijah's baleful prophecy, which Ishmael recounts to Ahab. The captain seems affected, but shakes off his doubts when Moby Dick reappears moments later. The Pequod crew sets out in their boats to bring him down. In the chaotic altercation, Moby Dick destroys Ahab's boat, but Ahab climbs onto the whale's back and stabs him until Moby Dick submerges, entangling Ahab in the harpoon lines on his back and drowning him. Instead of calling off the hunt, Starbuck orders the men to continue. Moby Dick attacks the boats, smashing them and killing the men; he then rams and sinks the Pequod before disappearing. Ishmael, the only survivor, manages to cling onto Queequeg's coffin until he is found and picked up by the Rachel."
X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James' birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas' other son Victor Creed, who is James' half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War in 1973. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James returns to Victor upon the commotion, and ignorant of his brother’s intent, he rushes to defend him. This results in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few missions, with James using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave. Six years later, in 1979, Logan works as a logger in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan, reporting that Wade and Bradley have been killed; someone is targeting the team. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, realizes that Victor is responsible. He finds Victor at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker orders that Logan's memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple takes him in. Zero kills the couple the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor. Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor still works for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called ""The Island"". Fred mentions Remy ""Gambit"" LeBeau, the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been forced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a ""mutant killer"" with the powers of multiple mutants. While Logan and Victor fight off Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to Professor Charles Xavier and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering him unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed, then succumbs to her injuries. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read ""Logan"" on one side and ""Wolverine"" on the other. He pauses upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her. In a mid-credits scene, Stryker is detained for questioning by MPs in connection with the death of General Munson, whom Stryker murdered to protect his experiment. In a post-credits scene, following the defeat of Deadpool, his hand crawls out of the rocks and touches his head, which awakens and shushes the screen, revealing that he has survived being decapitated."
Last Holiday,"Georgia Byrd is a shy, unassuming salesperson in the cookware department at Kragen's Department Store in New Orleans and a Baptist choir singer who longs to cook professionally. She privately records her dreams of a better life in a scrapbook labeled ""Possibilities"" enjoys replicating TV chef Emeril Lagasse's gourmet recipes, serving her creations to a neighbor while denying herself the pleasure of eating them. During the Christmas season, while flirting with handsome co-worker Sean Williams, whom she has secretly featured in her scrapbook as her dream husband, Georgia bumps her head. Taken to the store's health center for a CT scan, she is told by the company physician that she has several brain tumors resulting from a rare terminal neurological disorder called Lampington's disease. As her HMO plan does not cover the high cost of an operation, Georgia resigns herself to having only a few weeks to live. She quits her job, liquidates her assets, and sets off on a dream vacation at the deluxe Grandhotel Pupp in the Czech Republic's spa city of Karlovy Vary. Free of inhibitions and determined to enjoy the final weeks of her life, Georgia checks into the Presidential Suite and buys a designer wardrobe in expensive boutiques. She then also makes extensive use of the hotel's spa facilities, attempts snowboarding and BASE jumping, enjoys succulent meals prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier, and wins a small fortune playing roulette in the casino. Georgia impresses the hotel's staff, with the exception of the cantankerous guest services manager Ms. Gunther, with her naive manner and forthright kindness. She also mingles with some of the other guests, including Matthew Kragen, an arrogant self-help guru and the owner of the department store where she worked; Kragen's assistant/mistress Ms. Burns; and Louisiana power brokers Senator Dillings and Congressman Stewart. Kragen is wary of Georgia and suspects her of trying to sabotage his business, but the rest are charmed by her free spirit. When Kragen bribes Ms. Gunther to dig up information about Georgia's background, she goes through her hotel suite. She finds a letter Georgia has written providing instructions for the disposal of her remains after her death. Moved by the letter and realizing Georgia's self-confidence and sunny optimism have touched everyone who has met her since her arrival, Ms. Gunther confesses to Georgia she snooped through her belongings and found the letter. She urges her to return home and spend her last days with those she loves. Taking Ms. Gunther's advice, Georgia heads for the airport but discovers an avalanche has blocked the road. Unbeknownst to her, Sean, having learned of Georgia's diagnosis and ready to acknowledge his long-standing feelings for her, has flown to Europe and is in a taxi on the other side of the snowdrift, blocked from reaching her at the hotel. Georgia returns to the hotel, and Sean leaves his taxi to hike across the snow on foot. Chef Didier invites her to assist him in the hotel's kitchen that night preparing an extravagant New Year's Eve feast and thanks her publicly at the party. Later, seated at dinner and incensed by the accolades and affection Georgia has received, Kragen tries to humiliate her to his companions by exposing her as a saleswoman in one of his stores, but Georgia confirms this and reveals her terminal illness. Kragen's companions, disgusted by his insensitivity, embrace her and abandon him. Dejected and embarrassed, Kragen goes to an upper floor of the hotel and sits on the ledge, contemplating suicide. Georgia tries to dissuade this, suggesting if he were nicer and less driven by greed, he would be a happier person. Sean arrives at the hotel just in time and joins Georgia on the ledge, confessing his affection for her and admitting he'd seen her scrapbook. In the lobby, Ms. Gunther finds a fax for Georgia stating she was misdiagnosed due to a faulty CT scanner and does not have Lampington's disease. Ms. Gunther rushes up to the ledge to announce the good news. Georgia and Sean return to New Orleans as a couple where they open a restaurant, Georgia's Joint, which is visited by Chef Didier and Emeril Lagasse."
Nimona,"The citizens of a medieval-futuristic kingdom are protected by the Institute for Elite Knights, established by the legendary heroine Gloreth who a thousand years ago, vanquished a ""Great Black Monster"" and enclosed the kingdom with a high wall. Ballister Boldheart, along with his fellow knight and boyfriend, Ambrosius Goldenloin, is about to be knighted. Ballister is the first commoner to become a knight, as Queen Valerin is trying to change tradition so that ""anyone can be a hero"". During the ceremony, a laser shot from Ballister's sword kills Valerin. A distraught Ambrosius ends up cutting off Ballister's right arm, and Ballister becomes a fugitive. As Ballister hides and crafts a prosthetic replacement arm, he is visited by a shapeshifter named Nimona, who has faced persecution for her powers. Seeing a ""villainous spirit"" in Ballister, as he is facing similar treatment for his commoner origin and the murder of the Queen, Nimona declares herself to be his sidekick. To clear Ballister's name, the duo kidnaps Diego, the squire who gave him the sword. Diego gives them video evidence revealing that the Director of the Institute is the murderer. The duo confronts Ambrosius and the Director with the evidence, but the Director manipulates her knights into destroying the evidence. Later, Ambrosius confronts the Director, who stabs him and admits that she framed Ballister and murdered the Queen, as she objected to the Queen revising tradition by allowing commoners to become knights, fearing that doing so would lead to the kingdom's downfall. However, ""Ambrosius"" turns out to be a disguised Nimona. Ballister records the Director's confession, then posts it online, leading to public outcry. The Director discovers through ancient scrolls that Nimona is the Great Black Monster defeated by Gloreth. She uses this to convince the public that Ballister used Nimona's powers to fake the confession. The real Ambrosius meets with Ballister and reveals Nimona's past, insisting that Nimona deliberately deceived Ballister. Shocked by the revelation, Ballister argues with Nimona and questions their friendship; feeling betrayed, Nimona flees into the woods. Stopping at an old abandoned well, Nimona reminisces about her past: a thousand years ago, she wandered the world and turned into other animals to try and fit in with the wildlife, but none of the creatures she encountered accepted her. One day, she encountered Gloreth as a child by the well, and turned into a human for the first time. After seeing Nimona, Gloreth immediately welcomed her and the two became best friends, and Gloreth was accepting of Nimona's powers. However, the other citizens of Gloreth's village, including Gloreth's parents, believed Nimona was a monster after discovering her shapeshifting abilities. The villagers attacked Nimona with torches, which accidentally set the village on fire. A confused Gloreth became hostile toward Nimona. With Ballister's abandonment and Gloreth's betrayal echoing in her head, a distraught Nimona transforms into the Great Black Monster. She then enters the city, intending to commit suicide by impaling herself on the sword of Gloreth's statue. However, before she can do so, Ballister stops her and apologizes to her, causing Nimona to change back to human form as they embrace and make amends. The kingdom's citizens see this and are moved by it. Meanwhile, the Director, unmoved, orders a laser cannon to be fired from the wall to kill Nimona; Ambrosius protests, knowing that firing the laser into the city will kill innocent civilians. The Director then turns on them using the same laser she used to kill the Queen and prepares to fire the cannon herself. To save the kingdom, Nimona assumes a giant, red phoenix-like form and flies into the cannon, resulting in her apparent death, as well as the death of the Director. The resulting explosion destroys part of the wall, revealing a beautiful, mountainous valley behind it. Sometime later, the kingdom undergoes several changes: the breach in the wall has become a passageway through which citizens travel freely, Nimona and Ballister are honored as heroes, and Ballister's relationship with Ambrosius has been restored. Ballister visits his old hideout. He hears Nimona's voice, and joyfully realizes that she has survived."
Anomalisa,"In 2005, middle-aged English-born lonely customer service expert and motivational speaker Michael Stone travels to Cincinnati, Ohio to promote his latest book at a convention in a hotel. He feels distant from everyone around him, whom he perceives as having an identical face and voice, including his wife and son. Michael practices his talk in his room in the fictional Fregoli Hotel, but is haunted by the memory of an angry letter from an old flame, Bella, whom he abruptly left years ago without an explanation. He arranges to meet her in the hotel bar; still upset, she is outraged by his invitation to his room and storms out. Going for a walk, Michael mistakes an adult toy store for a children's toy store. Wanting to buy his son a present, he goes in and discovers his mistake, but is fascinated by a Japanese animatronic doll behind the counter. After taking a shower, Michael hears a unique female voice. He rushes from his room to find its owner: Lisa, an insecure young woman attending the convention with her friend Emily. Enraptured by her unique appearance and voice, he invites both women for drinks at the bar. Afterward, to Lisa's surprise, Michael invites her to his room. Captivated, he encourages her to sing (she chooses Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"") and tell him about her life. After she calls herself an ""anomaly"", he nicknames her Anomalisa. They become intimate and have sex. Michael has a nightmare in which the lower half of his face falls off and the identical people of the world pursue him, claiming that they love him and insisting that he and Lisa cannot be together. The dream inspires Michael to propose that he and Lisa start a new life together. She agrees, but her eating habits during breakfast annoy him, and her voice and face begin to transform into those of everyone else. During his convention talk, Michael suffers a breakdown, saying that he has no one to talk to and ranting about the American government, alienating the audience. Michael returns to his home in Los Angeles, California. He gives the Japanese animatronic woman to his son who is nonplussed and notices a mysterious substance leaking from it. Michael's wife notes the substance resembles semen but dismisses it nonchalantly. She has arranged a surprise party for Michael but he does not recognize any of the attendees, angering her. Michael sits alone on the stairs as the animatronic woman, bearing facial damage in the same locations as Lisa's facial scarring, sings ""Momotarō's Song"", a Japanese children's song. Lisa writes Michael a letter, saying she hopes they will meet again. Lisa's friend Emily, sitting beside her in the car, has her own unique face."
Megamind,"Two alien babies, one given a fish-like sentient creature called ""Minion"", are catapulted away from their home planets when they are sucked into a black hole. Approaching Earth, the baby with Minion crashes in a prison yard and is brought up by the inmates while the other lands safely in a mansion. The former's learning environment leads him to have criminal tendencies, festered by repeated punishment for acts in the classroom defused by the more advantaged baby. Many years later, the baby raised by the prisoners has become supervillain Megamind and has fought his counterpart, now superhero Metro Man for dominance of Metro City. In his latest plan, Megamind and Minion (now with a large humanoid mechanical suit) kidnap reporter and Metro Man's “girlfriend” Roxanne Ritchi and hold her hostage in a copper-lined observatory. When Metro Man arrives to save her, he finds the observatory empty and that Megamind lured him into a trap. Metro Man is revealed to be weak to copper and incinerated by Megamind's death ray. Megamind finally takes control of the city and enjoys his celebration with Minion. However, Megamind soon finds his life is meaningless without Metro Man. While wandering the recently opened Metro Man Museum, Megamind sees Roxanne nearby and uses his holographic disguise watch to take the form of Bernard, the museum's curator. He talks to Roxanne and becomes attracted to her, and is inspired by one of her statements to create a new superhero for him to fight. Megamind returns to his lair and creates a serum containing Metro Man's DNA, which he plans to inject into a proper candidate with his Defuser Gun. However, Roxanne's arrival at his lair with her dimwitted cameraman, Hal Stewart, causes Megamind to inadvertently inject the serum into Hal. Megamind disguises himself as Hal's ""Space Dad"" and convinces him to become the superhero ""Titan"". Hal spends several days training with Megamind before issuing a challenge to fight him. On the day before the fight, Megamind and Minion are driven apart by Megamind's decision to give up villainy for Roxanne, while Hal gets spurned by Roxanne attempting to woo her. Megamind, disguised as Bernard, takes Roxanne on a dinner date. Shortly thereafter, Roxanne unwittingly unmasks Megamind's identity and storms off in denial. Upset, Megamind decides to remain a villain. Hal does not arrive at the scheduled fight, and Megamind discovers that he has used his abilities for criminal purposes. Revealing himself as ""Space Dad"" and ""Bernard"" to him, Megamind successfully goads an enraged Hal into fighting him. Hal overpowers Megamind, but decides to kill him instead of arresting him. Megamind tries to trap Hal in a ball of copper, but to Megamind's horror, Hal easily tears right through it. Megamind manages to escape from the battle, leaving Hal to take over the city. Megamind seeks out Roxanne, who offers to take him to Metro Man's secret headquarters, where they are both surprised to find Metro Man alive. Metro Man reveals that he faked his own death and weakness to retire from being a superhero in favor of becoming a music star as ""Music Man""; He declines to help, but tells Megamind that a hero will always rise up to challenge evil. Refusing to become the hero, Megamind allows himself to be imprisoned. Roxanne confronts Hal, who kidnaps her and demands Megamind show himself. Seeing her in danger, Megamind pleads with the prison warden to set him free and apologizes for his actions. The warden reveals himself to be Minion in disguise. Accepting Megamind's apology, they reconcile. Just as Hal is about to kill Roxanne, Megamind manages to save her, but gets injured by the broken tower. Metro Man arrives, having had a change of heart, and chases Hal away from the city. Roxanne discovers that Megamind is actually an injured Minion in disguise and Metro Man is Megamind. Hal returns after recognizing Megamind's distinctive mispronunciations and resumes fighting him. Megamind manages to find his invisible car he misplaced in the previous night, grabs the Defuser Gun and is able to extract the serum from Hal, restoring him to normal. Hal is arrested for his crimes. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead, while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival. In a mid-credits scene, Minion finds Bernard in a washing machine and knocks him out with the same forget-me stick he used on Hal earlier in the film."
M,"A group of children are playing an elimination game in the courtyard of an apartment building in Berlin[5] using a chant about a child murderer. A woman sets the table for dinner, waiting for her daughter to come home from school. A wanted poster warns of a serial killer preying on children, as anxious parents wait outside a school. Little Elsie Beckmann leaves school, bouncing a ball on her way home. She is approached by Hans Beckert, who is whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" by Edvard Grieg. He offers to buy her a balloon from a blind street-vendor. He walks and talks with her. Elsie's place at the dinner table remains empty, her ball is shown rolling away across a patch of grass, and her balloon is lost in the telephone lines overhead. In the wake of Elsie's death, Beckert sends an angry letter about his crimes to the newspapers, from which the police extract clues using the new techniques of fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. Under mounting pressure from city leaders, the police work around the clock. Inspector Karl Lohmann, instructs his men to intensify their search and to check the records of recently released psychiatric patients to look for those with a history of violence against children. They stage frequent raids to question known criminals, disrupting underworld business so badly that Der Schränker (""The Safecracker"") calls a meeting of the city's criminal bosses. They decide to organize their own manhunt, using beggars to watch and guard the children. The police discover two clues corresponding to the killer's letter in Beckert's rented rooms. They wait there to arrest him. Beckert sees a young girl in the reflection of a shop window. Following her, he is thwarted when the girl meets her mother. When he encounters another young girl, he succeeds in befriending her, but the blind beggar recognizes his whistling. The blind man tells one of his friends, who tails the killer with assistance from other beggars he alerts along the way. Afraid of losing him, one young man chalks a large M (for Mörder, meaning ""murderer"" in German) on his hand, pretends to trip and bumps into Beckert, marking the back of his clothing. The beggars close in. When Beckert finally realizes he is being followed, he hides inside a large office building just before the workers leave for the evening. The beggars call Der Schränker, and a team of criminals arrives. They tie up and torture a guard for information. After capturing the remaining watchmen, they systematically search the building from coal cellar to attic, finally catching Beckert. When a watchman manages to trip the silent alarm, the crooks narrowly escape with their prisoner before the police arrive. One, however, is captured and eventually tricked into revealing the purpose of the break-in (nothing was stolen) and where Beckert would be taken. The criminals drag Beckert to an abandoned distillery to face a kangaroo court. He finds a large, silent crowd awaiting him. Beckert is given a ""lawyer"", who gamely argues in his defense but fails to win any sympathy from the ""jury"". Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that his urges compel him to commit murder, while the other criminals present break the law by choice. His ""lawyer"" points out that the presiding ""judge"" is himself wanted on three counts of totschlag (a form of homicide under German law). Beckert pleads to be handed over to the police, asking, ""Who knows what it's like to be me?"" Just as the enraged mob is about to kill him, the police arrive to arrest both Beckert and the criminals. As the real trial passes, five judges prepare to pass judgment on Beckert. Before the sentence is announced, the shot cuts to three of the victims' mothers crying. Elsie's mother says no sentence would bring back the dead children, and ""One has to keep closer watch over the children."" The screen goes black as she adds, ""All of you. ""[6]"
The Red Turtle,"A man set adrift by a storm wakes up on a beach. He discovers that he is on an uninhabited island with plenty of fresh water, fruit, and a dense bamboo forest. It is dominated by a smooth rock hill. After a few nights he begins to hallucinate, firstly seeing a string quartet playing on the beach. He builds a raft from bamboo and attempts to sail away, but his raft is destroyed by an unseen creature in the sea, forcing him back to the island. He tries again with a larger raft, but is again foiled by the creature. A third attempt ends with the raft destroyed, but this time he is confronted by a giant sea turtle with a bright red shell. That evening, the man sees the red turtle crawling up the beach. In anger, he hits it on the head with a bamboo stick, then flips it over onto its back, stranding it. While working on another raft, he feels remorse and returns to the turtle but it is too heavy for him to flip over. He fetches water for it, but when he returns, it is dead. He falls asleep next to it. In the morning, the man is surprised to find a red-haired woman lying unconscious inside the shell, which has split. He fetches water for her and builds a shelter to protect her from the sun. When rain hits, the woman wakes up and goes swimming. The woman casts the shell adrift on the sea and the man does the same to his raft. The two fall in love. The couple have a red-haired son. The curious boy finds a glass bottle and his father and mother tell him their story through pictographs. After accidentally falling into the sea, the boy learns he is a natural swimmer, and swims with three green turtles. He swims back to his mother, who hugs him and looks out at the sea with apprehension. The boy grows into a young man. One day, a tsunami hits the island, destroying most of the bamboo forest and separating the family. After the tsunami recedes, the young man searches for his parents and finds his mother wounded with no sign of his father. He swims out to sea and is joined by three turtles. They find his father clinging to a large bamboo tree. Just as he slips under the water, they arrive and rescue him. The young man also finds his glass bottle, and the family clean up the wreckage and burn the dead bamboo. One day the young man has a dream about swimming away into the sea. The water becomes static, allowing him to swim to the top of a huge wave, from which he can see further over the horizon. He says goodbye to his parents and swims away with the three green turtles. The man and woman continue to live on the island and grow old together, still very much in love. One night, after gazing at the Moon, the man closes his eyes and dies. The woman grieves. She lies next to him, and lays her hand on his. As her hand transforms into a flipper and she transforms back into the red turtle, she crawls down the beach and swims away."
The BFG,"Sophie, a ten-year-old girl living in a London orphanage, is often awake at the ""witching hour"", due to having insomnia. One night, she sorts some mail and shouts at some men causing trouble in a nearby alleyway. Later, she sees an elderly Giant Man outside her window, who captures her and takes her to his home in Giant Country. He explains that he cannot allow Sophie to return to her world and reveal the existence of giants. If she ventures out alone, she may be eaten by the nine much larger giants. In his workshop of dreams, the giant fashions a nightmare to convince the sleeping Sophie to stay with him in safety. The Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants, intrudes and demands a ""boo-boo"" on his finger to be fixed. He smells Sophie, but the elderly giant convinces him to leave upon him nearly eating a disgusting vegetable called a snozzcumber which Sophie briefly hid in. Sophie persuades the friendly giant to take her to visit Dream Country. They accidentally awaken the other giants, and after the Bloodbottler suggests they ""frolic"", they bully the friendly giant. A thunderstorm drives the man-eating giants into their cave, but the Fleshlumpeater finds Sophie's dropped blanket. In Dream Country, Sophie and the friendly giant catch good and bad dreams. The giant reveals that his only name – besides ""Runt"", the other giants' nickname for him – is ""the Big Friendly Giant"", which leads Sophie to call him ""BFG"". She accompanies him to London for his nightly work: using his dream trumpet to spread good dreams to sleeping children. They return to Giant Country just as the other giants have departed to go eat the children worldwide. The BFG realizes that Sophie has lost her blanket, exposing her presence to the other giants, and leaves her outside her orphanage. Revealing that his last human companion liked to read, and even taught The BFG how to read, but sadly was discovered and eaten by the giants, he is unwilling to endanger Sophie and departs. Unafraid, Sophie jumps off her balcony hoping he will appear again to catch her, and he does. They return to the BFG's workshop and the other giants barge in, hunting for Sophie. They destroy much of the BFG's work, but Sophie evades detection and the BFG drives them off with a hot iron. Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, with a portrait of Queen Victoria among his belongings. This inspires her to devise a plan: to forge a nightmare for Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom, about giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing to her. Sophie and the BFG go to Buckingham Palace and deliver the nightmare to the sleeping Queen. Upon waking, the Queen and members of her staff Mary and Mr Tibbs find Sophie on the windowsill. She introduces them to the BFG, explaining that the child-eating giants are real and must be stopped. At a large breakfast, the BFG shares his favourite drink, flatulence-inducing ""frobscottle"", and he and Sophie lead the Queen's soldiers to Giant Country. The BFG plans to ambush the man-eating giants with a nightmare but has forgotten his dream trumpet. Sophie carries the nightmare herself into the midst of the giants and is confronted by the Fleshlumpeater. She releases the nightmare which consumes the giants with guilt, except the unregretful Fleshlumpeater (who intercepts and destroys his), and they are trapped by military helicopters. Carried away to an isolated island, the giants are left with only ""snozzcumbers"" seeds to plant. Sophie gets adopted by Mary, comes to live in the Queen's palace, and awakens from a dream of the BFG, who returns to his life at Giant Country and writes the story of their adventure. She speaks to him whenever she feels lonely; at his home, the BFG hears her words and smiles."
Duplex,"Young, professional New York couple Alex Rose and Nancy Kendricks are in search of their dream home. The seemingly perfect Brooklyn brownstone duplex has one flaw: Mrs. Connelly, an old Irish lady who lives on the rent-controlled top floor. Assuming she won't live long, they buy the apartment. However, they soon realize Mrs. Connelly is lively, enjoys blasting her TV 24-7 and rehearsing in a brass band. A novelist, Alex must finish his latest against a looming deadline. However, he is interrupted constantly daily by Mrs. Connelly, and it quickly escalates into an all-out war. They try to get her to move out, but she refuses. Next, they try to file a noise complaint against her, but discover that she has gone to the police first and filed a harassment charge against them. Their friends turn against them when she play-acts as the ""poor, innocent, old lady"" making it appear they are out to harm her. Nancy loses her job and Alex misses his deadline thanks to the old lady's antics, so they are trapped at home together with Mrs. Connelly with no place to go. Their rage turns to homicidal fantasy as they plot ways to get rid of their manipulative, no-good neighbor. Peace overtures and a break-in lead to nothing, so they hire a hitman, Chick, to kill her. His asking price for the hit is $25,000. Desperate and needing the money in two days, they sell almost everything they own to pay for the Christmas Eve hit. Chick breaks into Mrs. Connelly's apartment as planned, but fails to kill her as she defends herself with a speargun, shooting him in the shoulder. She is incapacitated in the fight, and the duplex catches fire. Nancy and Alex appear to leave her to die, but then return and save her and her parrot. The fire department puts out the fire. Accepting defeat, Alex and Nancy leave, and find out the old woman has just died. Moving away, they contemplate their strange encounter. We then learn they are not the first to be elaborately scammed by: the realtor of the duplex, Kenneth (Mrs. Connelly's son); the ill-tempered NYPD Officer Dan (Kenneth's boyfriend) who had frequently harassed and distrusted the couple, always siding with Mrs. Connelly in her disputes against them, and Mrs. Connelly herself (who is not in fact dead). The real-estate scam has been run by the trio for several years: Kenneth sells the ground-floor apartment to an unsuspecting, naive young couple. Then Mrs. Connelly, aided by Dan, harasses them, eventually forcing them to move out. Finally, she fakes her own death so they will never suspect a thing, thus leaving them to collect and live off of the sales commission from the next unsuspecting occupants. Alex and Nancy were their latest victims among many. Despite everything, as they celebrate their latest victory, she admits she actually liked Alex and Nancy and hopes they find success and happiness elsewhere. A final voice-over by Alex relates that he and Nancy relocated to The Bronx. Like the other couples the trio scammed, they never saw Mrs. Connelly or returned to Brooklyn again. Alex used their unpleasant experience as inspiration for his next book entitled Duplex, which became a best-seller, rescuing him and Nancy from poverty and giving the film a semi-happy ending."
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Ace Ventura, an offbeat private detective in Miami, is known for rescuing tame or captive animals. Despite struggles with rent and constant mockery from the Miami Police Department, led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn, Ventura is hired by Melissa Robinson, the Miami Dolphins' publicist, to find their kidnapped mascot, Snowflake, just weeks before the Super Bowl. Investigating the kidnapping, Ventura finds a rare amber stone in Snowflake's tank, leading him to suspect billionaire Ronald Camp, a collector of exotic animals. However, after sneaking into Camp's party and facing a dangerous encounter with a shark, Ventura rules out Camp as the stone in his ring matches the one found but is not missing. Ventura then theorizes that the stone is from a 1984 AFC Championship ring, suggesting a member of the 1984 Dolphins as the culprit, but finds all rings intact. Roger Podacter, the Dolphins' head of operations, dies mysteriously, and Ventura proves murder. His investigation leads him to Ray Finkle, a disgraced former Dolphins placekicker who missed the potentially game-winning kick in the 1984 Super Bowl and blamed quarterback Dan Marino for it. Ventura also learns that Finkle had been committed for homicidal tendencies shortly after the Dolphins released him following the Super Bowl loss. With Marino's subsequent kidnapping, Ventura suspects Finkle is seeking revenge. Disguised as a patient at a psychiatric facility, Ventura discovers that Lieutenant Einhorn is actually Finkle, who had altered his appearance and infiltrated the police for revenge. On Super Bowl Sunday, Ventura confronts Einhorn at a yacht storage facility, holding Marino and Snowflake hostage. In a dramatic revelation, Ventura exposes Einhorn as Finkle, leading to her arrest after a physical altercation. The climax unfolds at the Super Bowl's halftime, where Marino and Snowflake are celebrated, and Ventura is hailed as a hero on the jumbotron. The event is humorously capped off by Ventura's scuffle with the Philadelphia Eagles' mascot over a rare pigeon, earning him a standing ovation."
2001 Maniacs,"Six prep college students and a biker couple travel south towards Daytona Beach for Spring Break, but a detour leads them into the seemingly idyllic Georgia town of Pleasant Valley, which is holding its annual ""Guts and Glory Jubilee"" in honor of the American Civil War. While they stay in the town, completely isolated from the outside world, they are systematically separated and killed in gory fashion by the town's residents. Two students manage to escape, but upon alerting the authorities they learn that ""Pleasant Valley"" is nothing but a cemetery - a memorial for 2001 Confederate villagers who were massacred 140 years earlier by renegade Union troops during the Civil War. A plaque reveals that the town's residents will not rest until the crime has been paid back: 2001 villagers were killed, 2001 Northerners must be killed - an eye for an eye. As the two students drive away on their motorcycle, they are decapitated by barbed wire. The heads are picked up by Hucklebilly who walks down the road and fades away."
Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey,"The music of Wyld Stallyns has created a utopian future society. In the year 2691, former gym teacher turned terrorist Chuck De Nomolos attacks the Bill & Ted University and steals a time-traveling phone booth, intending to alter the history of what he considers to be a foolish and frivolous society by sending evil robot replicas of Bill and Ted back to the late 20th century to prevent the originals from winning the San Dimas Battle of the Bands. Rufus attempts to stop De Nomolos but seemingly becomes lost in the circuits of time. In the present, Wyld Stallyns are auditioning for an upcoming Battle of the Bands. Though Bill and Ted's current girlfriends and former 15th-century princesses Joanna and Elizabeth have become skilled musicians, the duo themselves are still inept. Despite this, the organizer, Ms. Wardroe, assures them a slot in the contest as the final act and informs them that victory will result in a record deal and $25,000 prize money. Following a party, the duo proposes to their girlfriends just as the evil robots arrive from the future. After luring the human duo away to Vasquez Rocks and killing them by throwing them over the side of a cliff, the robots begin working to ruin Bill and Ted's eventual fame along with their relationships with their fiancées. In the afterlife, Bill and Ted's souls are met by Death who says they may challenge him in a game for their souls, but warns that nobody has ever won. Bill and Ted escape after giving Death a ""melvin"". Attempts to contact the police by possessing Ted's father and a deputy fail, and their next attempt for help at a séance held by Missy ends with them being sent to Hell. Tormented by Satan and forced to face their own fears, the duo realize their only escape is to take Death's offer; he then appears and allows them to choose a game. To Death’s dismay, they select modern games like Battleship, Clue, Electric Football and Twister, beating him every time. Finally, he reluctantly concedes, placing himself at their command. Realizing they need to locate the smartest person in the universe to help build robots to counter De Nomolos's evil robots, Death escorts the pair to Heaven. God directs the group to an alien duo named ""Station"", who readily agree to help them. The two Stations run at each other, merging to form a single giant being. On the eve of the Battle of the Bands, Bill and Ted are brought back to life. Having obtained supplies from the Builders Emporium store, Station constructs benevolent robot versions of Bill and Ted in the back of the van as they race back to the concert. Elsewhere, the evil robots abduct the girls and tie them high above the stage at the Battle of the Bands, intending to drop them to their deaths at the finale. Bill and Ted arrive just as the evil robots take the stage; the benevolent Good Robots easily defeat their evil counterparts and Joanna and Elizabeth are lowered by Station before their ropes break. De Nomolos appears in the time booth, preparing to kill Bill and Ted himself, and overrides the broadcasting equipment to send a live feed of their confrontation across the entire planet. Bill and Ted deduce that they can go back in time following the encounter to arrange events for De Nomolos to be captured in the present; though De Nomolos attempts to follow suit, the duo turn the tables by explaining that only the winners get to go back. After De Nomolos is ""melvined"" by Death and arrested by Ted's father Captain Logan, Ms. Wardroe reveals herself to be a disguised Rufus, who gives them the stage. Acknowledging their ineptness, the duo decide to use the time booth; they immediately return to the auditorium with their families, which now include young children, after sixteen months of intense guitar training and a two-week honeymoon. Joined by Death, the Stations and the good robots on stage, Wyld Stallyns perform a stunning rock ballad as De Nomolos's broadcast continues, broadcasting their music worldwide and creating harmony. The victorious Wyld Stallyns encounter many perks of fame that help them to fulfill their destinies and create their utopian society with their music, eventually taking their act to Mars."

Don't Look Up,"Kate Dibiasky, a doctoral candidate in astronomy at Michigan State University, discovers an unknown comet. Her professor, Doctor Randall Mindy, confirms that it will collide with Earth in approximately six months and is large enough to cause a global extinction event. NASA verifies the findings, and Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of their Planetary Defense Coordination Office, accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to the White House. However, they are met with apathy from President Janie Orlean and her Chief of Staff Jason Orlean, who is also her son. Oglethorpe encourages Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, which they do so on The Daily Rip, a popular morning talk show. When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic lightly, Dibiasky loses her temper and angrily rants about the threat before she flees the scene. Mindy receives public approval for his looks, while Dibiasky becomes the subject of negative memes for her on-air behavior. Actual news about the comet's threat receives little public attention, and the danger is denied by Orlean's NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a top donor to Orlean with no background in astronomy. When news of Orlean's sex scandal with her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon is exposed, she distracts from the bad publicity by finally confirming the threat and announcing a project to strike and divert the comet using nuclear weapons. The mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements. The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergone peer review. Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as the National Science Advisor. Dibiasky attempts to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee. World opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home to Illinois, her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally rants on national television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference. Cut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign on social media, telling people to ""Just Look Up"" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. Simultaneously, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people ""Don't Look Up"". Orlean and BASH cut Russia, India, and China out of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. As the comet becomes larger in the sky, Orlean's supporters start turning on her administration. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed. Isherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board a sleeper spaceship designed to find an Earth-like planet, inadvertently leaving Jason behind. Orlean offers Mindy two places on the ship, but he declines, choosing to spend a final evening with his friends and family. As expected, the comet strikes off the coast of Chile, causing a worldwide disaster and triggering an extinction-level event. The shockwave strikes Mindy's house, killing everyone inside. In a mid-credits scene, the 2,000 people who left Earth before the comet's impact land on a lush alien planet 22,740 years later, ending their period of suspended animation. They exit their spacecraft naked and admire the habitable world. However, Orlean is suddenly killed by a bird-like predator, one of a pack that surrounds the planetary newcomers. In a post-credits scene back on Earth, it is revealed that Jason managed to survive the impact. He records himself, declaring himself the ""last man on Earth"" and asking any viewers still alive to ""like and subscribe""."
Demolition Man,"In 1996, psychopathic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a number of hostages, and takes refuge with his gang in an abandoned building. LAPD Sgt. John Spartan uses a thermal scan of the building; finding no trace of the hostages, he leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. Phoenix sets off a series of explosives that demolish the building, and the hostages’ corpses are found in the rubble; Phoenix claims Spartan knew about the hostages and attacked anyway. Both men are incarcerated in the city's new ""California Cryo-Penitentiary"", where they are cryogenically frozen and exposed to subliminal rehabilitation techniques. In 2032, Phoenix is thawed for a parole hearing and he escapes. Lieutenant Lenina Huxley has Spartan thawed to help stop Phoenix. She explains to Spartan that San Angeles—a metropolis that combines the former Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara—is a peaceful utopia, and the police are no longer equipped to deal with violent crime. Spartan finds the new future depressing and oppressive; human behavior is tightly controlled, physical contact and swearing are illegal, and anything else deemed ""bad"" is also banned. Likewise, others on the police force find Spartan's behavior brutish and uncivilized. Spartan anticipates that Phoenix will attempt to secure firearms. He and Huxley head to a museum and find Phoenix already there. Phoenix escapes with the weapons and encounters Dr. Raymond Cocteau, the evangelistic pseudo-pacifist who has been running San Angeles since the ""Great Earthquake"" of 2010. To his confusion, Phoenix finds that he is unable to shoot Cocteau, who reveals that he had orchestrated Phoenix's escape all along. As a safety measure, Cocteau implanted a command that prevents Phoenix from harming him. Cocteau wants Phoenix to assassinate Edgar Friendly, the leader of a resistance group called the Scraps that resists his rule. Spartan and Huxley witness this exchange on security cameras and review the cryo-prison records. To their shock, they find that Phoenix's rehabilitation program has been replaced with combat training programs and the information necessary for his escape. Spartan meets with the Scraps in time to ward off an attack by Phoenix and other criminals who have been thawed out of cryo-sleep to help assassinate Friendly. Phoenix taunts Spartan, revealing that he had killed the 1996 hostages before setting off the bomb, meaning Spartan has spent 36 years in prison for no reason. Phoenix escapes, and Spartan arms himself with help from the Scraps. Phoenix returns to Dr. Cocteau with his men, and has one of them kill Cocteau. They return to the cryo-prison and begin to thaw out more convicts. Spartan enters the prison alone to fight Phoenix, heavily damaging the facility in the process; he uses the cryogenic chemical to freeze and kill Phoenix. Spartan escapes the prison as it explodes. The police fear that the loss of Cocteau and the cryo-prison will end society as they know it, but Spartan suggests that they and the Scraps work together to combine the best aspects of order and personal freedom. He then kisses Huxley and the two go off together."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","In the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving over the rape and murder of her teen daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them: ""Raped While Dying"", ""And Still No Arrests?"", ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"". They attract attention, so Bill Willoughby, the local chief of police, visits Mildred, but is unable to persuade her to take them down, even by revealing he has terminal pancreatic cancer. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere. Many townspeople are upset by the billboards, including Jason Dixon, an alcoholic police officer, who unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Mildred's dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and accidentally coughs up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice. The billboards have further strained Mildred's relationship with her son, Robbie, and she recalls that her last interaction with Angela was an argument. Her abusive ex-cop ex-husband Charlie confronts her about the billboards and ends up revealing that, shortly before Angela's murder, he had turned down her request to come live with him. At his mother's suggestion, Dixon arrests Mildred's friend Denise on trivial drug possession charges to put pressure on Mildred. Willoughby spends an idyllic day with his wife, Anne, and their two daughters, and then commits suicide later that night to spare his family from watching him die slowly. Dixon reacts to the news by assaulting Welby and throwing him out a second-story window. This is witnessed by Abercrombie, Willoughby's replacement, who fires Dixon. Before his death, Willoughby wrote several letters, including one to Mildred. Anne delivers it, interrupting an unknown man who was menacing Mildred at work. In the letter, Willoughby tells Mildred that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up another month. After the billboards are destroyed by arson, Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes to be unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is inside reading Willoughby's letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and embrace love if he wants to be a detective someday; he manages to escape the blaze with Angela's case file. James, an acquaintance of Mildred, happens by and extinguishes Dixon's burning clothes before providing Mildred with an alibi. Dixon is put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes. Jerome, who was part of the team that put up the billboards, brings Mildred a set of copies and helps her restore the signs. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who menaced Mildred bragging in a bar about raping a girl in the same manner as Angela. He notes the number on the man's Idaho license plate and then scratches the man's face to get a DNA sample, passively accepting the resulting beating. Mildred is on a date with James to thank him for his help, when Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and apologizes for burning the billboards when he was drunk. Unnerved that she retaliated against the wrong target, Mildred abruptly calls off the date, but James misinterprets her decision as embarrassment to be seen with him and leaves the restaurant in disgust. Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample is not a match and the man was overseas on military duty at the time of Angela's death. Dixon gives Mildred the disappointing news and, believing the man to be guilty of some other rape, the pair plan a trip to Idaho to kill him. As they set out, Mildred confesses that she set the police station on fire, which Dixon had already assumed. They both express uncertainty about their mission, but Mildred says they can decide what to do along the way."
Lord of War,"In the early 1980s, Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), the eldest son of a family of Ukrainian refugees, is visiting a Brighton Beach restaurant, where he witnesses a Russian mobster kill two would-be assassins holding Kalashnikov assault rifles. He is inspired to go into the arms trade, comparing the constant need for weapons to the similar human need for food. After completing his first sale, Yuri convinces his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) to become his partner. They leave their family's restaurant behind and go into business together. Yuri's first big break comes in the 1982 Lebanon War, when he sells guns to all sides of the conflict, despite witnessing war crimes and atrocities. As Yuri becomes more successful in the war's aftermath, his business comes to the attention of Interpol and in particular idealistic agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke). Valentine represents a unique threat to Yuri because he is after glory, not money, and thus cannot be bought off. Vitaly becomes addicted to cocaine after a Colombian drug lord uses drugs to pay for an arms deal. Yuri checks Vitaly into drug rehabilitation and continues his business alone. He lures childhood crush Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan) to a false photo shoot, where they fall in love and subsequently get married. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yuri flies to Ukraine and illegally buys tanks and weapons through his uncle, a former Soviet general overseeing a newly-independent Ukrainian Army arsenal with a massive surplus now that the Cold War is over. Yuri then expands to Africa and begins a business relationship with Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker), a ruthless dictator waging a never-ending civil war in Liberia. During one flight into Africa, Yuri's cargo plane is intercepted by Valentine and forced to land. Yuri escapes arrest by landing in a remote area and distributing the aircraft's illegal cargo to the locals. Unable to charge Yuri, Valentine tells Ava he is an arms dealer, prompting her to confront him and demand he stop his illegal business. For a time, Yuri complies and does his best to find alternate, legal ways of doing business, but Andre Baptiste Sr. visits him personally, offering a staggering sum in diamonds if he will return to black market arms dealing. Unable to refuse, Yuri agrees. Yuri convinces Vitaly to come along on a sale in Sierra Leone in 2001, where a militia force allied with Baptiste is visibly preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Sympathizing with the refugees, Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal, but Yuri refuses, arguing that if they do the militia will also kill them. Stricken with guilt, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades, destroying one of the weapon trucks and killing Baptiste Jr. Vitaly is shot and killed when the militia retaliate. Yuri reluctantly accepts half of the original diamond payment for the remaining weapons. Yuri ships his brother's remains back to the United States. He pays a doctor to forge a phony death certificate and to remove the bullets from Vitaly's body, but one bullet remains, and Yuri is stopped by the ATF. Meanwhile, while being followed by Jack Valentine, Ava finds Yuri's security container, finally establishing the definitive proof of Yuri's guilt. Ava also finds the container full of her paintings, which Yuri secretly bought. Ava takes their son and leaves him. When Yuri calls his parents, his mother says, ""Both my sons are dead."" Valentine detains Yuri and tells him that he has a long jail sentence ahead of him, but Yuri abruptly brings him back to reality. In a forward statement, he tells Valentine that there will be a knock at the door, that a high-ranking military officer will be standing outside, and that he will order Yuri's release. Yuri explains this by pointing out that some of his customers are enemies of the US's enemies; that the US President, ""who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year,"" sometimes can't be perceived as supplying them, and that Orlov's services in those cases are invaluable to US foreign interests. Valentine then hears a knock at the door. Realizing Yuri was right, he states, ""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there."" Valentine answers the pending knock and Yuri is released just as he predicted. Yuri soon returns to the arms trade, going on a trip to the Sahara Desert, ""Doing what I do best."""
Hannibal,"Ten years after tracking down serial killer Jame Gumb, FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid. She is later contacted by Mason Verger, the only surviving victim of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. A wealthy child molester, Verger was paralyzed and brutally disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out. After learning of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream with ingredients that are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In Florence, one of those cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker. Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program database of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Blinded by greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio, ties him up, then disembowels and hangs him from the balcony. Lecter then returns to the United States. Verger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling away and the boars eat Verger alive. Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet cocktail dress, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, sautés it, and feeds it to him. After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police and ambulance closing in, Lecter is just about to sever her cuffed hand to escape when he hesitates. She is soon seen to have both hands intact when she escapes. The paramedics take Krendler to hospital. His fate is not explained. Lecter is later shown on a flight with his own boxed lunch, his bandaged arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter shares the brain with the boy, saying it is important ""always to try new things."""
Capote,"In Kansas, a family friend discovers the dead bodies of four of the members of the Clutter family. While reading The New York Times, the story of the Clutters rivets writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban) to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy. Capote travels to Kansas, inviting childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to come along. Capote intends to interview those involved with the victims, the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator. Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead detective on the case, brushes him off, but Dewey's wife Marie (Amy Ryan) is a fan of Capote's writing and persuades Dewey to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner. She is starstruck by Capote's stories of being on movie sets with film stars. Dewey warms up to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims. The Deweys, Lee, and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard ""Dick"" Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are caught. Flattery, bribery and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote's visits to the prison where the accused are being held. Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith. He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book. Following the trial and conviction, Capote is able to gain continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch (Marshall Bell). Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when Capote goes off to Morocco and Spain to write the ""first three parts"" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). The story of Smith's life, his remorseful manner, and emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Smith refuses to tell Capote what happened on that fateful night, angering Capote. After much persuasion, Smith tells him in great detail. The story becomes a meditation upon the need for redemption even in very grave circumstances. Legal appeals drag on for years. Capote is exasperated, as he is unable to have his book published without an ending. In the meantime, Lee writes a novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which becomes a best-seller, to Capote's surprise and jealous annoyance. The last appeal is finally rejected. Capote is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are hanged, with Smith's hanging being explicitly shown. Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not have done anything to stop it. She replies, ""Maybe not; the fact is you didn't want to."" This is the last line of the film. The next and last scene shows Capote looking at photos from the case as well as writings and drawings given to him by Smith."
Chinatown,"In 1937, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes to follow her husband, Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly refuse to create a new reservoir that would be unsafe, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray and that he can expect a lawsuit. Realizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Hollis Mulwray is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that although there is a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes one of Gittes' nostrils. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries. Gittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes' fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply. Gittes deduces that the water department is drying up the land so it can be bought at a reduced price and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners who seemingly purchased the property a week after his death. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real-estate deals were surreptitiously completed in the names of several of the home's residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious retirement-home director, who has called Mulvihill. After fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. During the night, Evelyn gets a phone call and must leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn's car to a house, where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray's mistress, Katherine. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will, but she says Katherine is her sister. The next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions' apartment, where he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for Gittes' arrival. Escobar tells him the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the fresh water of the reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At Evelyn's mansion, Gittes finds her servants packing her things. He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of bifocals in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. After Gittes slaps her, she tells him that Katherine is her sister and her daughter; her father raped her when she was 15. She says that the glasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals. Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals at gunpoint, and they force Gittes to drive them to the women. When they reach the Chinatown address, the police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and starts to drive away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. Lawrence Walsh, one of Gittes's associates, tells him: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."""
Friday the 13th: Part 3,"After the events of Part 2, a badly injured and unmasked Jason Voorhees goes to a lakefront store for a change of clothes. While there, he murders the store owner Harold and his wife Edna. Meanwhile, Chris Higgins and her friends travel to Higgins Haven, her old home on Crystal Lake, to spend the weekend. The gang includes pregnant Debbie, her boyfriend Andy, prankster Shelly, his blind date Vera (who does not reciprocate his feelings), and stoners Chuck and Chili. After running into a man named Abel who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick at their destination. At a convenience store, Shelly and Vera get into a confrontation with bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco. Shelly gets in the car and knocks down their motorcycles, impressing Vera. Later, the bikers show up at Higgins Haven, where they take the gas out of the van and attempt to burn the barn down to get even. Jason, who has been hiding in the barn, murders Fox and Loco with a pitchfork before beating Ali unconscious. That night, Chris and Rick head out into the woods, where Chris reveals that she was attacked by a deformed man two years prior, which prompted her to leave Crystal Lake in the first place; the main reason that she returned was to confront her fears and escape the trauma. Back at Higgins Haven, a scorned Shelly scares Vera with a hockey mask and then wanders into the barn, where Jason slashes his throat. Taking his mask to conceal his face, Jason emerges from the barn. Vera retrieves Shelly's wallet from under the dock and is shot in the eye with a speargun. Jason enters the house and chops a hand-standing Andy in half with a machete. Debbie finishes her shower and rests on a hammock, where Jason thrusts a knife through her chest from beneath. When the power goes out in the house, Chuck goes downstairs to the basement only for Jason to hurl him into the fuse box, electrocuting him. Chili finds that everyone else is dead and is then impaled with a hot fire poker. When Rick's car dies, Chris and Rick are forced to walk back to the house to find it in disarray. Rick steps outside to search the grounds, but Jason grabs him and crushes his skull with his bare hands, making one of his eyes pop out of its socket. Jason then attacks Chris, who narrowly escapes the house and tries to flee in her van. The van runs out of gas and Chris makes her way to the barn to hide, but Jason attacks her again. Inside the barn, Chris strikes Jason over the head with a shovel and hangs him. He regains consciousness and temporarily removes his mask to free himself from the noose, which causes Chris to recognize him as the same man who attacked her two years prior. An awoken Ali tries to attack Jason, but Jason quickly finishes him off. The distraction allows Chris to strike Jason in the head with an axe. He staggers momentarily towards her before finally collapsing. Exhausted, Chris pushes a canoe out into the lake and falls asleep. Chris has a nightmare of an unmasked Jason running towards her from the house before disappearing, which then cuts to the decomposing body of Pamela Voorhees, with her head attached, emerging from the lake to pull her in. The following morning, the police arrive and escort a traumatized Chris away from Higgins Haven. Jason's body is shown to still be lying in the barn as the lake is shown, seemingly at peace."
Dust Devil,"In Namibia, a Sangoma named Joe Niemand recites a story about Dust Devils—anthropomorphized desert winds that roam the highways to hunt and kill humans. One Dust Devil kills a woman who had picked him up for sex, then burns her house and leaves her corpse in the car. Meanwhile, in the town of Bethanie, Sgt. Ben Mukurob receives a phone call with strange voices speaking, as does Wendy Robinson in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the morning, the man burns down Saarke's house and leaves in her car. In Johannesburg, Wendy's husband Mark accuses her of cheating on him, leading her to leave him and drive to Namibia. Investigating the scene, Sgt Ben Mukurob and Captain Beyman  find strange pictographs on the wall. Joe tells him that they are magic symbols, but Mukurob is skeptical. The Dust Devil is picked up by Wendy, a woman who had left her husband after he accused her of infidelity. When he sees another of his kind hitch-hiking, Dust Devil tells Wendy to drive past him, then disappears from the car. Meanwhile, two police officers find human remains in a camper near where Wendy picked up Dust Devil. With Dust Devil secretly watching, Wendy stops at a small motel for the night and tries to commit suicide but stops herself. Wendy goes to her car the next morning and finds Dust Devil inside, who tells her that she fell asleep the day before. Meanwhile, Beyman gives Mukurob documents about similar murders dating back to 1908. Wendy and Dust Devil reach the Fish River Canyon, as Wendy's husband Mark arrives in Namibia and begins his search for her. Joe tells Mukurob that the murders are the work of the ""naghtloper"", a shape-shifting demon who gains power over the material world through ritual murder. The naghtloper must keep moving to work the ritual, but if he is tricked to step over a kierie stick, he will be bound to one spot and his power can be taken. Joe gives Mukurob a kierie and a sacred root to burn to prevent the naghtloper from possessing him after it is killed. When Wendy discovers human fingers among Dust Devil's belongings, he tries to kill her but she escapes. Mukurob and Mark pursue them, but Dust Devil causes them to crash the car in a dust storm. Mukurob leaves Mark at the car and heads into the storm, telling him that he has a chance since the naghtloper only takes those who have nothing to live for. He finds Wendy reaches the abandoned town of Kolmanskop but is stabbed by Dust Devil. Mukurob blocks Dust Devil's path with the kierie, and Wendy uses Mukurob's shotgun to kill Dust Devil as he proclaims his love for her. Wendy walks into the desert past Mark and the car, lies on the road and pulls over a fleet of army Casspirs. Joe believes she has been possessed by the Dust Devil."
The Jacket,"After miraculously recovering from an apparently fatal bullet wound to the head, Gulf War veteran Jack Starks returns to Vermont in 1992, suffering from periods of amnesia. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie, and her alcoholic mother in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman. The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman's gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution. Starks is placed in the care of Dr. Thomas Becker, a psychiatrist, and his staff. In December 1992, Starks is forced to undergo an unauthorized treatment designed by Becker: he is injected with experimental drugs, bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie at a roadside diner where she works. He suspects this happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. She does not recognise him but seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and confronts her. Jackie, frightened, tells him that Jack Starks died on New Year's Day in 1993, and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning Jackie's trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life. Early on 1 January 1993, knowing that his time is quickly running out, Starks is briefly taken out of the hospital by Dr. Beth Lorenson, who he has finally convinced of his time travel experiences and his knowledge of future events. She drives Starks to the childhood home of Jackie and her mother, where he gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a lit cigarette in her hand and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks experiences a flashback to the head wound he suffered in Iraq, simultaneously slipping on the ice and hits his head. Bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time. Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter to Jackie's mother has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007.  She is no longer a waitress, is now dressed in a nurse's uniform, and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother — still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the ""previous"" future is not lost when Jackie says ""How much time do we have?"", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question is given by the words of the song: ""We have all the time in the world"" sung by Iggy Pop."
Bonnie and Clyde,"In the middle of the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker of Texas meet when Clyde tries to steal the car belonging to Bonnie's mother. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued by Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative. The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. Clyde's older brother Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher's daughter, also join them. The women dislike each other on first sight, and their feud escalates. Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde and C.W., while Bonnie sees Blanche's flighty presence as a constant danger to the gang's survival. Bonnie and Clyde turn from pulling small-time heists to robbing banks. Their exploits also become more violent. When C.W. botches parking for a bank robbery, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face after he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, whom they capture and humiliate before setting him free. A raid later catches the outlaws off guard, mortally wounding Buck with a shot to his head and injuring Blanche. Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. barely escape alive. With Blanche sightless and in police custody, Hamer tricks her into revealing C.W.'s name, who was up until then still only an ""unidentified suspect."" Hamer locates Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. hiding at the house of C.W.'s father Ivan, who thinks the couple—and an ornate tattoo—have corrupted his son. The elder Moss strikes a bargain with Hamer: in exchange for leniency for the boy, he helps set a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, the police in the bushes open fire and riddle them with bullets. Hamer and his posse come out of hiding and are shown looking pensively at the couple's bodies as a nearby flock of swallows fly away."
Moonrise Kingdom,"On the New England island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky attends Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scout Master Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both lawyers, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and become pen pals. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence, and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a specific location. Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp and Ward contact Sam's guardians the Billingsleys, learning they are actually his foster parents and Sam is an orphan with a history of behavioral issues at home. Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader Redford with a pair of scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet which they name ""Moonrise Kingdom."" They set up camp and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss. Suzy's parents, Ward, the Scouts, and Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent the next morning. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of a Social Services worker, who will likely place Sam in an orphanage and possibly treat him with electroshock therapy. While in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. Together, they paddle to neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Ben, an older cousin of the scout Skotak. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior, Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. He performs a wedding ceremony, which he claims is not ""legally"" binding, before they leave. Sam, Suzy, and Ben set off for the crabbing boat in a sailboat, but quickly return so that Sam can retrieve Suzy's binoculars. As Sam returns to the camp chapel to look for the binoculars, he is confronted by Redford, who alerts the camp to Sam and Suzy's presence. Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon, under the command of Ward, pursue them. A violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, he decides to become Sam's legal guardian. The hurricane erases Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet from the map. At Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, telling Suzy he will see her the following day."

Dangal,"Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former amateur wrestler trained in the pehlwani style of Indian wrestling, is a national wrestling champion residing in Balali, Haryana. His average Indian father forces him to give up the sport to obtain gainful employment. Dejected he could not win a medal for his country, he vows that his unborn son will. Disappointed on having four daughters, he gives up hope. But when his older daughters Geeta and Babita come home after beating two boys in response to derogatory comments, he realizes their potential to become wrestlers and begins coaching them. His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short forced haircuts. Despite facing backlash from the villagers, he goes ahead with them, training them in his makeshift mud pit. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but soon realize that he cares for their future. Motivated, they willingly participate in wrestling tournaments where they defeat boys. Unable to afford wrestling mats, Mahavir uses mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the state and national levels before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games. Once there, Geeta makes friends and begins to disregard the discipline taught by Mahavir under duress from her coach Pramod Kadam, whose training methods and wrestling techniques completely differ from her father's. Therefore, she loses every match at the international level. During a visit home, she defeats a visibly exhausted Mahavir in a ferocious bout after egotistically mocking him. Babita reminds Geeta of her mistake and that she should respect Mahavir. Soon after, Babita wins the national championship and follows Geeta to the academy. After the two sisters have an emotional conversation in which Babita provides her encouragement, Geeta tearfully makes peace with Mahavir. Before the Commonwealth Games, Pramod forces Geeta to compete in the 51 kg weight class rather than in her usual 55 kg. Irritated upon learning this, Mahavir goes to Patiala with his nephew Omkar and begins coaching the girls secretly. Learning about this, and furious with Mahavir's interference, Pramod wants the girls expelled; the sports authority issues a warning but allows them to continue. Mahavir is barred from entering the academy, and the girls are forbidden to go out. Determined to continue assisting his daughters, Mahavir obtains tapes of Geeta's previous unsuccessful bouts and coaches her by pointing out her errors over the phone. At the games, competing in the 55 kg class, Geeta eases her way into the final. Mahavir constantly contradicts Pramod's instructions while sitting in the audience, and she follows her father's instructions instead. Just before the gold medal bout, jealous Pramod conspires to lock Mahavir in a room. In the bout, Geeta manages to win the first session but loses the second. Trailing 1–5 in the final session and with nine seconds left, she recalls the tactics taught by her father and a 5-pointer, and executes it on her opponent in the final three seconds, taking the score to 6–5 in her favor, thus winning the session and the bout 2–1. In the process, she becomes the first Indian female wrestler to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Mahavir returns just in time to embrace his daughters, dashing Pramod's hopes of obtaining credit before the news media."
The Help,"In 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in Jackson, Mississippi. She works for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt and cares for the Leefolts' daughter Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend and fellow maid Minny Jackson works for Mrs. Walters, whose daughter Hilly Holbrook leads the women's socialite group. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, a recent graduate of Ole Miss and an aspiring writer, is a friend of Elizabeth. Skeeter is uncomfortable with her social circle’s racist attitudes toward their maids, including Hilly’s insistence on installing separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter learns that her mother Charlotte fired Constantine, the maid who raised Skeeter, and decides to write a book of interviews with African-American maids working for white families. Minny is fired by Hilly for using the guest bathroom and is rendered unemployable, but finds a job with Celia Foote, a housewife ostracized by the other socialites. Celia treats Minny with respect and they become friends, but keep Minny’s employment secret from Celia’s husband Johnny. Celia suffers a miscarriage, and reveals to Minny that she has had three previous miscarriages. Skeeter reaches out to Aibileen, who eventually agrees to be interviewed, as does Minny. Elaine Stein, Skeeter’s editor at Harper & Row, advises her that the stories of two maids are not enough, but fear of retribution prevents other maids from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her struggle to cope with the death of her son, and believes the book will help her find closure. Hilly refuses to advance money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. Yule May discovers a discarded ring and pawns it, but is brutally arrested as Hilly watches. This incident and the assassination of Medgar Evers inspire more maids to tell Skeeter their stories. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny reveals the ""terrible awful"" she did to Hilly: after her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie, but revealed that she baked her own excrement into the pie after Hilly had finished two slices. The inclusion of this incident in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson. Skeeter confronts her mother about firing Constantine, and Charlotte reveals that during a Daughters of America luncheon, Constantine's daughter Rachel disobeyed Charlotte's orders to enter through the kitchen, embarrassing her. To save face, Charlotte fired Constantine; Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. The book is published anonymously and is a success. Minny reveals the ""terrible awful"" to Celia, who finally sees what a manipulative bully Hilly is, and writes a cheque to one of Hilly's charity groups, made out to ""Two Slice Hilly"". Incensed, Hilly threatens Skeeter with legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that the incident is in chapter 12. Charlotte intervenes, letting on that she knows about the ""terrible awful"", and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is of her courage, the book, and her job offer in New York City. Johnny reveals to Minny that he knows she has been working at his house, and how appreciative he is for her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children and leave her abusive husband. Seeking revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, framing her for theft. Aibileen stands up to Hilly, who breaks down and storms out, and Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Mae Mobley and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure, looking to her own future as a writer."
Bringing Out the Dead,"In Manhattan in the early 1990s, Frank Pierce is a burned-out hospital paramedic who works the graveyard shift in a two-man ambulance team with various partners. Usually exhausted and depressed, he has not saved any patients in months and begins to see the ghosts of those lost, especially a homeless adolescent girl named Rose whose face appears on the bodies of others. Frank and his first partner Larry respond to a call by the family of a man named Mr. Burke who has entered cardiac arrest. Frank befriends Mr. Burke's distraught daughter Mary, a former junkie. Frank discovers Mary was childhood friends with Noel, a brain-damaged drug addict and delinquent who is frequently sent to the hospital. After a few minor calls (one involving Noel), Frank and Larry respond to a shooting and he tends to one of the surviving victims. Frank notices two vials of a drug named ""Red Death"", a new form of heroin that is plaguing the streets of New York City, roll out from the victim's sleeve which implies it was a shooting by a rival drug gang. While in the back of the ambulance with Frank and Noel the victim goes into denial and repents his drug dealing ways but dies before they can reach the hospital. The next day Frank is paired with his second partner Marcus, an eccentric and religious man. They respond to the call of a man in a goth club who has suffered a heart attack. Frank diagnoses that he has in fact suffering from a heroin overdose caused by Red Death. As Frank injects the man with Narcan, Marcus starts a prayer circle with the baffled club-goers and just as his preaching climaxes the overdosed man becomes conscious again. On the way back to the hospital Frank swings by Mary's apartment building to tell her that her father's condition is improving. Frank and Marcus then respond to a call by a young Puerto Rican man whose girlfriend is giving birth to twins despite his claims they are both virgins, calling it a miracle. Frank rushes one baby to the hospital it seemingly dies; but afterwards a conversation between Frank and Marcus reveals that the baby survived. In a moment of desperation Frank starts drinking and Marcus soon joins in, crashing the ambulance into a parked car. The following morning, Frank sees a stressed Mary leaving the hospital and follows her to an apartment block; she tells Frank that she's going to visit a friend and he escorts her to the room. After a while Frank goes to the room and barges his way in the door, only to discover it's in fact a crack house run by a friendly dealer named Cy Coates. Mary has turned back to drugs to cope with her father's fluctuating condition and Frank tries to get her to leave but he is dissuaded by Cy who offers Frank some pills. In another moment of desperation he swallows the drugs and begins to hallucinate, seeing more ghosts of patients and the moment when he tried to save Rose. Once over, he grabs Mary and carries her out of the building. While visiting a comatose Mr. Burke in the hospital Frank starts hearing Burke's voice in his head, telling Frank to let him die but he resuscitates Burke instead. The next shift Frank is paired with his third partner Tom Wolls, an enthusiastic man with violent tendencies. At this point Frank is slowly beginning to lose his mind - while tending to a suicidal junkie Frank manages to scare the patient away. The pair are then called to Cy's drug den where another shooting has occurred, and find Cy impaled on a railing, having attempted to jump to safety. Frank holds on to Cy as the other emergency services cut the railing but Cy and Frank are nearly flung off the edge before being pulled back up. Cy then thanks Frank for saving his life - the first patient Frank has saved in months. Afterwards Frank agrees to help Tom beat up Noel, but Frank is distracted and Noel flees into an area beneath the houses. Tom and Frank chase after Noel but Frank starts to hallucinate again, snapping out of it just as he comes upon Tom beating Noel with his baseball bat. During his second visit to Mr. Burke, the voice again pleads to let him die, and this time Frank removes Burke's breathing apparatus causing him to enter cardiac arrest, ending his life. Frank then heads to Mary's apartment to inform her, and she seems to accept her father's death. Frank is invited in, falling asleep at Mary's side."
The Siege,"FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and his Lebanese American partner, Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub), intervene at the hijacking of a bus fully loaded with passengers, which contains an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists escape. The FBI receives demands to release Sheikh Ahmed (Ahmed Ben Larby) bin Talal, a radical Iraqi cleric who was suspected to have ordered the earlier bombing at the American embassy in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia who was captured and extracted while going to Lebanon by a group of American covert operators of Lebanese - American ancestry in the introductory scene of the film, who was then imprisoned in an undisclosed location after being extracted while the U.S. Government prepared to prosecute him for his role in the barracks bombing. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with Central Intelligence Agency agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), as he takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Later, another terrorist threat is made and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus is bombed. The feds captures a man named Samir Nazhde (Sami Bouajila), who admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The terrorist incidents escalate, including the bombing of a bus and a crowded theater, a hostage-taking at an elementary school, and the destruction of One Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, with over 600 casualties. In spite of objections, the President of the United States declares martial law and the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division, under the command of Major General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis), occupies and seals off Brooklyn in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently, all young men of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr., are rounded up and detained in Downing Stadium. Haddad resigns in outrage. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the Army and the profiling of the Arabs; the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings. Hubbard and Kraft, now revealed to be an agent named Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini (Amro Salama). Devereaux's men torture and kill Husseini in the course of the interrogation. Afterward, Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini revealed nothing of value because of the principle of compartmentalized information. Sickened, Bridger finally admits that she provided training and support to militants opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime, working with Samir to recruit and train the followers of the Sheikh. After the U.S. cut their funding and left them exposed, she took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by Hussein's forces, and arranged for them to escape to the United States, ultimately leading to the present situation as they turn their bomb making and covert skills on the country that now holds their leader. Sharon and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with the final terrorist cell. Hubbard also convinces Haddad to return to the FBI. A multi-ethnic peace march demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, ""there will never be a last cell."" He straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate among the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to prevent him leaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the abdomen as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard and Haddad kill Samir but despite their best efforts the pair can only watch as Bridger succumbs to her wound after managing to recite certain lines of the second half of the Lord's Prayer and concluding with ""Inshallah"" – the Arabic phrase ""God Willing"". Hubbard, Haddad, and their team raid Devereaux's headquarters to make an arrest for the torture and murder of Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the War Powers Resolution the authority vested in himself by the President supersedes that of the court which issued the arrest warrant. Deveraux then commands his soldiers to aim their assault rifles at the agents, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all of his predecessors have fought and perished for. Devereaux finally submits and then gets arrested. Martial law ends and the detainees, including Haddad's son, are given their freedom."
Beautiful Boy,"New York Times writer David Sheff's teenage son Nicolas ""Nic"" Sheff goes missing, reappearing in their home two days later. Seeing obvious signs of drug use, David takes Nic to a rehab clinic. Progress is made, and Nic transfers to a halfway house, with the agreement of Nic's doctors. Days later, Nic disappears, and David finds him in the streets. Back at the rehab facility, Nic reveals that he has been taking numerous drugs, including crystal meth. Nic eventually completes his rehab program, and seeing his improvements, combined with wishful thinking, David allows him to go away to college on his own, to become a writer. Nic's newfound freedom and sobriety start well, as he becomes a good student, and starts a relationship with his classmate, Julia. During a happy family dinner at his girlfriend's parents' house, Nic finds a bottle of pills in their medicine cabinet and swallows one. After this incident, he slowly relapses, causing Julia to break up with him, and his substance use to escalate until he eventually purchases heroin. Around this time, beginning to become suspicious of his slowly changing behavior, David decides to read Nic's diary. To his horror, Nic has filled half the pages by colorfully describing his growing addictions through worrying words and disturbing cartoons. On one of the last pages, Nic writes of his difficulty obtaining meth in college, but that he managed to score some heroin. Returning home, David senses that Nic is using again, and Nic leaves of his own accord, feeling claustrophobic from his dad's suspicions about his drug use. David and Nic finally meet up, and Nic asks his dad for money, so he can go to New York. Knowing the money will almost certainly go towards drugs, David declines, and Nic angrily leaves. David later gets a call from a New York hospital saying Nic has overdosed. David flies there to retrieve him, and after talking to his ex-wife and Nic's mother Vicki, he decides Nic should be sent to live with her in Los Angeles. Nic has a fresh start in Los Angeles. He attends 12 step meetings, spends time with his sponsor Spencer, and even works at a drug clinic to help newer patients overcome their addiction. Fourteen months sober, Nic drives to visit David and his family. Seeing Nic back to his old self, interacting happily with his two younger half-siblings, David is proud of his son's newfound sobriety, as is his wife Karen. As he departs from their home, however, Nic has a sudden surge of depression, resents his sobriety, and fears relapsing. Spencer gives Nic moral support over the phone, but to little avail. Later that night, Nic drives into San Francisco, where he runs into Lauren, a fellow drug addict from his past, and confesses his desire to ""party,"" despite having been clean for quite some time. The two buy various drugs in the streets, which they proceed to inject together at Lauren's place, where they have sex. When he learns Nic has gone missing again, David prepares to look for him, but Karen protests that he has done everything he can for Nic, and he cannot do anything to fix his addiction, which David heartbrokenly accepts. One day Nic and Lauren break into the home while David and his family are not there, and retrieve some valuable items. The family come home, and the two quickly depart. At first, they go undetected, but David's other son Jasper notices Nic, and both David and Karen go to find them. Karen chases them in their car but stops and lets them drive off. Lauren overdoses, but is revived by Nic and is sent to the hospital. Nic tearfully calls David and asks for permission to come home, which his father declines. Nic continues to plead, but David hangs up and breaks down in tears. Despairing, Nic overdoses, but he survives. David and Vicki visit him in the hospital, and David and Nic tearfully embrace. Closing credits reveal Nic has been sober for 8 years, and it would not have been possible without the love and support of his family and friends. During the credits, Nic recites 'Let It Enfold You' by Charles Bukowski."

Bean,"Mr. Bean is a well-meaning yet clumsy and destructive security guard working at the ""Royal National Gallery"" in London. When the gallery's board of directors, who despise Bean for sleeping on the job, fail to fire him due to the chairman threatening repercussions, the board immediately decides on a different course of action and has him represent them during the transfer of the portrait Whistler's Mother to the Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles, following its purchase by philanthropist General Newton for $50 million. The curator of the Grierson, David Langley, who is impressed with the false profile of ""Dr. Bean"", agrees to accommodate him at his house for two months, much to the chagrin of his wife Alison, his son Kevin and daughter Jennifer. After Bean encounters mishaps with the airport police and accidentally breaks a family heirloom, Alison leaves for her mother's house along with Kevin and Jennifer. David begins to question Bean's intelligence after he suggests they head to an amusement park where he rigs the control panel of a simulator ride to make it more exciting for him, resulting in him getting him arrested a second time, and he later messes up a dinner with the gallery's owner George Grierson. When David questions Bean, he finds out that Bean is not a doctor after all. Bean admits to knowing absolutely nothing about art, and things get worse when he accidentally defaces the painting shortly after it arrives, by wiping it with an ink-stained handkerchief after sneezing on it and attempting to remove the stain with strong chemicals, which leave a large white patch where Bean had attempted to wipe away the mess he made. He tries to recreate the face using a pen, but fails. Fearing that he will lose his job and possibly face criminal charges for the damage, David becomes despondent and gets drunk, even though his family returns out of pity. To save David's career and not get arrested again, Bean sneaks back into the gallery, distracts the guard by lacing his cup of coffee with laxatives and replaces the defaced painting with a modified poster. The plan works on the next day, fooling everyone including Newton. Bean nearly panics when he has to make a speech, but gives an improvised, sentimental and deep monologue about the painting that wins the crowd's praise and approval. Bean is then approached by Lieutenant Brutus (with whom he crossed paths on two earlier incidents), making David worried that he knows the truth about the priceless painting's mishap, only to learn from him that Jennifer was rushed to a hospital after being involved in a motorcycle accident along with her boyfriend, Stingo. Rushing to the hospital, David goes to be with his wife, leaving Bean to wander around the hospital's reception area and be mistaken for a doctor after picking up a stethoscope that had been accidentally dropped onto the floor. Forced into a surgery room and dressed in surgical scrubs, Bean comes across Brutus on the operating table (who had been shot while dealing with a mugging), whereupon he manages to remove the bullet from his body via an unorthodox procedure which saves his life. Not recognizing him, David then begs Bean for his help in reviving Jennifer from a coma, to which he succeeds after an accident with a defibrillator sends him flying and landing on top of her. Grateful for having their daughter back, David and Alison are surprised when Bean reveals his true identity. At Bean's suggestion, they repay him by allowing him to stay with them for another week. After spending some quality time with David's family, Bean heads back to the airport and thanks David for the time he spent with them before returning home to London. At his flat, Bean admires his bedroom which is now decorated with photos of himself and the Langleys as well as the original Whistler's Mother painting he ruined and smuggled back with him, before going to bed. After the credits, Bean walks into the black screen and says ""Yes I normally stay till the end as well...bye"". Bean walks off, but comes back and says ""You can go now if you wish"". Bean looks at his watch and says ""Bye"" before walking off and the film ends."
The Iron Giant,"An object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, which is a 50-foot-tall extraterrestrial robot; he runs away but then returns to save the robot when he gets electrocuted while trying to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth encounters the Giant again and the Giant befriends Hogarth because the Giant witnessed Hogarth saving him. The Giant is docile and curious. The train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, and discovers that he can self-repair. Hogarth shows the Giant comic books and compares him to the hero Superman. Hogarth also learns that the Giant is unable to recall his origins or reasons for coming to Earth, which Hogarth suspects is because of damage the Giant received while landing. The incidents lead a paranoid U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer. The deer encounter causes the giant to have a nightmare that shows the background of who he was; a war machine built to conquer worlds by an evil alien civilization that destroyed itself in a civil war. Hogarth is interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and summons a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces. Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system, who fires a laser beam in the process. Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth, and the guilt-ridden Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase. Dean quickly realizes that the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant. The Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, which wins over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell and informs Rogard, who sends the Army to attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth, which forces the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant gives in to his defensive system in a fit of rage and grief by transforming into a war machine, which makes it attack and chase the military all the way back to Rockwell as they return fire. Rogard is nonetheless unnerved at Mansley's insistence on countering the Giant with a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, but orders Nautilus to stand by as the military's conventional firepower proves ineffective. Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. Rogard stands down his remaining forces and prepares to order the Nautilus to abort the launch order, but a hysterical Mansley impulsively orders the missile launch anyways, because he is convinced that the Giant remains a threat. The missile is targeted to hit Rockwell, where it will destroy the town upon impact in the resulting nuclear explosion. Rogard stoically accepts the situation, but a panicked Mansley steals a jeep and attempts to flee. The Giant blocks and disables the jeep, and Mansley is held at gunpoint and arrested on Rogard's orders. The Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. The Giant remembers Hogarth's words and declares himself ""Superman"" as he collides with the missile, which explodes high in the atmosphere, which saves Rockwell and the military forces nearby. The Giant is presumably destroyed, which leaves Hogarth and Rogard devastated. Dean and Annie have a chat at a memorial of the Giant made by Dean, that was standing in Rockwell. Hogarth receives a box containing a single screw from the Giant, which was the only remnant recovered. Dean adds that General Rogard sent it, because he believed Hogarth should have it. Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself."
The Brady Bunch Movie,"Larry Dittmeyer, an unscrupulous real estate developer, convinces all the families in his neighborhood — except for the Brady family — to sell their property as part of a plan to turn the area into a shopping mall. The Bradys have their own problems. Jan is jealous of her elder, popular sister Marcia. Cindy is tattling about everything she hears. Greg is dreaming of becoming a singer, but sings folk songs more appropriate to the 1970's. Peter is beginning puberty with his voice starting to break. He is exposed to numerous titillations through sex education and his very attractive teacher Miss. Linley. He is also trying to win the affection of the girl he loves, Holly, but thinks his shy and awkward personality prevents him from doing so. Bobby is excited about his new role as hall monitor at school. Cindy gives Mike and Carol a tax delinquency notice (which was mistakenly delivered to the Dittmeyers) stating that they face foreclosure on their house if they do not pay $20,000 in back taxes. The two initially ignore the crisis, but when Mike's architectural design (which is exactly the same as their house) is turned down by two potential clients, he tells Carol that they may have to sell the house. Cindy overhears this and tells her siblings. They look for work to raise money to save the house, but their earnings are nowhere near enough to reach the required sum. Mike sells a Japanese company on one of his dated designs, thereby securing the money, only for Larry to sabotage it by claiming that Mike's last building collapsed. On the night before the Bradys have to move out, Marcia suggests that they enter a ""Search for the Stars"" contest, the prize of which is $20,000. Jan, having originally suggested this and been rejected, runs away from home. Cindy sees her leave and tattles, and the whole family goes on a search for her. They use their car's citizens' band radio, and their transmission is heard by Schultzy, a long-haul trucker who picks up Jan and convinces her to return home. The next day, the children join the ""Search for the Stars"" contest. Peter finally builds the confidence to stand up to Eric Dittmeyer, Peter's tormentor and Holly's boyfriend. This earns him a kiss from Holly, which gives him a deep masculine voice. The children's dated performance receives a poor audience response compared to the more modern performances of other bands. However, the judges — Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork of The Monkees — vote for them, and they win the contest as a result. The tax bill is paid and their neighbors withdraw their homes from the market, foiling Larry's plan and securing the neighborhood. Larry ends up with being sued by the other neighbors before getting arrested for sabotaging the Brady's home. Carol's mother arrives and finally convinces Jan to stop being jealous of Marcia, only for Cindy to start feeling jealous of Jan."
Where the Wild Things Are,"Max is a lonely 9-year-old boy with an active imagination and divorced parents. His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's snow fort with him inside during a snowball fight. Out of frustration, Max messes up her bedroom and destroys a frame he made for her. Later, his mother, Connie, invites her boyfriend Adrian to dinner. Max becomes upset with her for not spending time with him that evening as they had agreed. Wearing his wolf suit, he begins to wreak havoc among the house. As Connie scolds him, he lashes out by biting her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away from home and into a forest, scared by what transpired. At the edge of a pond, Max finds a small boat that he boards. Eventually, Max reaches an island that is home to a group of seven large monsters called the Wild Things - namely, Carol, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Douglas, the Bull, and KW. Carol is in the middle of a destructive tantrum caused by the departure of KW. Max tries joining in on the mayhem, but finds himself facing the suspicious anger of the Wild Things. When they contemplate eating him, Max convinces them that he is a king with magical powers capable of bringing harmony to the group. They crown him as their new king. Shortly after, KW returns, and Max declares a ""wild rumpus"" in which the Wild Things smash trees and tackle each other, before going to sleep in a pile with Max at the center. Carol takes Max on a tour of the island, showing him a model he built depicting what he wishes the island looked like. Inspired by this, Max orders the construction of an enormous fort. When KW brings her two owl friends, Bob and Terry, to the fort, a disagreement ensues as Carol feels they are outsiders. To release their frustrations, Max divides the tribe into ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" for a dirt clod fight. However, Alexander is injured during the game, and Carol berates KW for jokingly stepping on his head, prompting the latter to leave once again. Max finds Alexander alone in the fort, whereupon he reveals that he knows Max is not a king with magical powers, but warns him never to let Carol know. However, Douglas reveals the truth when Carol throws another tantrum in the middle of the night over the state of the fort and Max's failure to fulfill his duties as a king. Enraged, Carol rips off Douglas's right arm - though only sand pours from the wound - before chasing Max into the forest and attempting to eat him. Max is saved by KW, who hides him in her stomach. After Carol leaves, KW explains to Max how difficult their lives are, with Carol's tantrums only making matters worse. Max realizes what his mother is going through and decides to leave the island. Max finds the crushed remains of Carol's model island and leaves a token of affection for him to find. Max finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king. The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat. Carol runs to join them after finding Max's token and arrives in time to see him off. He starts to howl and Max howls back; all the other Wild Things join in. Carol looks at KW, and she smiles kindly at him. Returning home, Max is embraced by his mother, who gives him a bowl of soup, a piece of chocolate cake, and a glass of milk. She sits with him as he eats and he watches as she falls asleep at the table."
Stuart Little 2,"Set three years after the events of the first film, Stuart Little has settled into family life with his parents, older brother George, and baby sister Martha, who has yet to say her first words. Stuart is becoming tired of his adoptive mother Eleanor's overprotectiveness due to his small size, and is finding himself lonely when George would rather play with his own friend, Will. When playing by himself, Stuart accidentally wrecks George's toy plane, prompting George to furiously throw it into a trash can. Stuart's adoptive father Frederick tells him there is a 'silver lining' to every bad situation, and encourages him to find a new friend of his own. When driving home from school in his roadster, Stuart meets Margalo, a canary who falls into his car. Margalo states she has injured her wing being chased by a predatory Falcon, and Stuart takes her home to recover. Unbeknownst to the Littles, Margalo is in fact physically healthy, and is working with Falcon to steal precious items from households. However, she soon bonds with the Littles, and feels immense guilt over what she is planning to do; Falcon warns her that if she does not complete their plan, he will kill Stuart. Margalo steals Eleanor's ring, prompting Stuart to venture down the Littles' kitchen drain in an unfruitful attempt to find it again. He soon finds himself in trouble, but Margalo rescues him; realizing the danger she is putting him in, she leaves the next morning. Stuart becomes convinced Falcon has kidnapped her, and sets off to find her with the family cat Snowbell, convincing George to conduct a series of elaborate (and extremely unconvincing) lies to Eleanor in order to cover for him. Stuart and Snowbell seek out street-cat Monty, who tells them that Falcon lives at the top of the Pishkin Building, and warns that he is an extremely dangerous foe. Stuart uses a balloon to fly to the summit of the Pishkin Building, but is taken aback when Margalo reveals her alliance with Falcon. Falcon traps Margalo in a paint can, and attempts to kill Stuart by dropping him from the sky; Stuart instead lands in a garbage truck and is taken to a garbage barge out at sea. Initially devastated at the series of events, Stuart soon finds his silver lining by rediscovering and subsequently repairing George's broken toy plane, which he uses to fly back to land. Meanwhile, George, after being reprimanded by his parents for his deception and interrogated on Stuart's true whereabouts, confesses where Stuart is to them, prompting them to head out and look for him. In the meantime, Snowbell has also ventured up the Pishkin Building, and frees Margalo from the paint can, only to become trapped in it himself. Margalo breaks free from Falcon's control, and flies away with Eleanor's ring, prompting Falcon to give chase. Stuart arrives in his toy plane, and a furious chase occurs through New York, with the Littles following from behind. Stuart ultimately wins the battle by using the ring to blind Falcon's vision, before jumping from the plane and allowing it to crash into Falcon as he falls into a trash can and is presumably eaten by Monty. The day saved, Frederick and Eleanor forgive Stuart for running away and George for lying to them, and tell them they are extremely proud of them for their bravery. Later, Margalo fulfills her dream of flying south for the winter, planning on returning to the Little household in the spring. Martha stuns everyone by using her first words to say goodbye to Margalo."
Pan's Labyrinth,"In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths, which act as portals, around the world in preparation for her return. In 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal believes strongly in Falangism and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom. Ofelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen's bed and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task — retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task. During this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the rebels. After killing two local farmers, Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at the rebel's own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator, Vidal kills him. Vidal later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal's son. A discovered spy, Mercedes tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the rebels. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by rebels, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead. Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her as ""Your Highness"". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies. The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, ""visible only to those who know where to look."""
How to Train Your Dragon 2,"Five years after the Viking villagers of Berk and the dragons made peace, Hiccup and his Night Fury, Toothless, map out unexplored lands. His father, Stoick the Vast, wants him to succeed as chieftain, although Hiccup feels unsure if he is ready. While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers. Their leader Eret attempts to capture their dragons for their employer, Drago Bludvist, who plots to capture and enslave all dragons into becoming his soldiers. Hiccup and Astrid escape and warn Stoick about Drago. Stoick fortifies Berk to prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe war is inevitable and flies off to talk to Drago. Stoick tries to stop him, explaining that he once met Drago at a gathering of chieftains, where Drago had offered them protection from dragons if they pledged to serve him; but they refused him, so he had his dragons attack them, with Stoick the sole survivor. Undeterred, Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him. They instead meet a mysterious dragon rider, who is revealed to be Hiccup's long-lost mother, Valka, who was assumed to have been killed by a dragon after being carried off during a dragon raid. She explains that, like her son, she could not bring herself to kill dragons, so she's been rescuing dragons from Drago and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic, ice-spewing alpha dragon called a ""Bewilderbeast"", which is able to control smaller dragons by emitting hypnotic sound waves. Stoick and his lieutenant Gobber track Hiccup to the nest, where Stoick discovers his wife is alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders force Eret to lead them to Drago, who captures them and their dragons and, learning of Berk's dragons, sends his armada to attack the dragon nest. He also attempts to execute Eret, but Astrid's dragon, Stormfly, saves him. A grateful Eret later helps her and the others escape. At the nest, a battle ensues between the dragon riders, Valka's dragons, and Drago's armada, during which Drago reveals his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the alpha. The two colossal dragons fight, ending with Drago's Bewilderbeast killing its rival, becoming the new alpha, and seizing control of all the dragons. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders his Bewilderbeast to have Toothless kill him. The hypnotized Toothless fires a plasma bolt toward Hiccup, but Stoick pushes him out of the way and is killed instead. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives Toothless away in a fit of despair over his father's death. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. The group holds a Viking funeral for Stoick, and Hiccup, having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encouragingly tells him he alone can unite humans and dragons. Inspired by her words and his father's, Hiccup and his allies return to Berk to stop Drago by riding the baby dragons, which are immune to the Bewilderbeast's control. Back at Berk, they find that Drago has attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. Hiccup frees Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control and confronts Drago, but the Bewilderbeast encases them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice and enters a glowing super-powered state, making him immune to the Bewilderbeast's control. Toothless then challenges the Bewilderbeast to protect his rider, repeatedly shooting it in the face, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new alpha. The dragons fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats with Drago on his back, drowning Drago in the ocean. The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory, and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk, while the dragons from both Berk and Valka's sanctuary accept Toothless as their new alpha. Berk undergoes repairs, with Hiccup feeling confident that they will defend their peace with their dragons."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"In 1926, British wizard and ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander arrives in New York City. He observes Mary Lou Barebone, the non-magical (""No-Maj"" or ""Muggle"") head of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, preaching that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. Attempting to recapture a Niffler that escaped from his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt meets No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, an aspiring baker, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein, a demoted Auror of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), arrests Newt for breaking magical law. Since the suitcase in his possession only contains Jacob's baked goods, Newt is released. At home, Jacob opens Newt's suitcase, inadvertently freeing several creatures into the city. After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his suitcase, magically expanded to house various creatures including an Obscurial, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children when their abilities are suppressed; those afflicted rarely live past the age of ten. After they recapture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA, but they are arrested, as officials believe one of Newt's creatures is responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw Jr., who was actually attacked by a different Obscurial. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and obliviate Jacob's recent memories. Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. Queenie senses this, rescues Jacob before his memory can be wiped, then helps Newt and Tina escape and retrieve Newt's suitcase. A tip from Tina's goblin informant Gnarlak leads the four to recapture the last of the escaped creatures. Graves approaches Credence, Mary Lou's adult adopted son, and offers to free him from his abusive mother in exchange for helping to find the Obscurial causing destruction throughout the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed, which Mary Lou assumes is his; when Credence is about to be punished, the Obscurial kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves, assuming Modesty is the Obscurial' host, dismisses Credence as a Squib and refuses to teach him magic as he had promised in return for service. Credence reveals he is the real host, having survived due to the intensity of his magic, and attacks the city in broad daylight. Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel but is attacked by Graves. Tina, who had tried to protect Credence from Mary Lou (leading to her demotion), attempts to calm the boy, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence returns to human form, MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery and the Aurors counterattack, shattering the Obscurial. However, unseen by anyone but Newt, a single wisp of the creature flees the scene. Graves admits he had planned to unleash the Obscurial to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and then frame Newt for the incident. He claims MACUSA's laws openly protect No-Majs at the expense of the magical community, and he no longer cares to live in hiding. Picquery orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, but he defeats them. Newt captures him with the help of one of his beasts and reveals that Graves is Grindelwald in disguise. MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion that obliviates recent memories over the city as rainfall, while MACUSA wizards repair the destruction and erase all evidence of their existence. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories, and Newt returns to England. Jacob opens a bakery with pastries resembling Newt's beasts, and, when Queenie enters, he smiles at her."
Ginger Snaps,"In Bailey Downs, a rash of dog killings has been occurring. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death, and as children, formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on the way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger. As the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer. Following the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. Her wounds heal quickly, and she starts to behave aggressively, grow hair from her scars, sprout a tail, and menstruate heavily. She begins dating her classmate Jason McCardy. One night, Ginger bites Jason's neck and has unprotected sex with him, despite his insistence to use protection. Later, she furiously beats Trina in public, and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to obtain information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is transforming into one. Sam suggests infusing an extract of monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, a perennial plant often referred to in lycanthrope folklore. Trina accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. She fights with Ginger and is accidentally killed. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers, and the fingers are misplaced. On Halloween, Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates an extract of the herb. Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected by Ginger when they had sex), and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behavior, which proves it is a cure. At school, she discovers Ginger's murder of a faculty member and witnesses her killing another. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him. The girls' mother finds the fingers and Trina's corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, saying that she will protect them. Brigitte arrives to find Ginger hurting Sam for rejecting her sexual advances. Brigitte wounds Ginger's and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger's blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. Ginger feels her transformation approaching and Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back to the Fitzgerald house to prepare more of the cure for her. Ginger transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, a transformed Ginger attacks him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte's insincerity, and kills Sam. As Ginger chases Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and weeps."
The Lovely Bones,"In 1973, 14-year-old high school freshman, Susie Salmon, dreams of becoming a photographer. One day, Ray, a boy she has a crush on, asks her out. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey, who coaxes her into an underground ""kid's hideout"" he has built. Inside, Susie grows uncomfortable and attempts to leave; Harvey grabs her and the scene fades until she is seen rushing past her alarmed classmate Ruth Connors, seemingly fleeing Harvey's den. The Salmons become worried when Susie fails to return home from school. Her father, Jack, searches for her, while her mother, Abigail waits for the police. In town, Susie sees Jack, who does not respond to her when she calls. Susie runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing the bloody bathroom and her bracelet hanging on the sink faucet, Susie realizes she never escaped the underground hideout because Harvey murdered her. Screaming, she is pulled into the ""In-Between"", which is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, and resists her new afterlife friend Holly's urging her to let go. Investigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Fenerman, Jack believes Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He researches neighbors and eventually suspects Harvey is the killer. Fenerman is unable to find proof, as Harvey has carefully concealed the evidence. Susie's sister, Lindsey, agrees with Jack's suspicions, but their casework takes a toll on Abigail. Abigail's alcoholic mother, Lynn, moves into the house. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail goes to California. Susie, in her afterlife, learns that Harvey, who has targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has murdered six other girls, including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a large safe in his basement. One night, Jack, carrying a baseball bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across a teen couple named Clarissa and Brian. Brian, thinking they will be assaulted, bludgeons Jack nearly to death as Harvey watches nearby while Clarissa begs him to stop. As Jack recuperates, Lindsey breaks into Harvey's house looking for evidence that he killed Susie. Upstairs, she finds a notebook containing a sketch of the underground den, a lock of Susie's hair, and news articles about Susie's disappearance. Harvey returns and almost catches Lindsey, but she escapes and rushes home to discover that her mother has returned. She gives the notebook to her grandmother, who contacts the police. Harvey has already fled his home – taking the safe containing Susie's body with him. Susie's afterlife begins expanding into a larger heaven, and she is greeted by Harvey's other victims. She resists Holly's urging her to enter Heaven along with the others, claiming she has one final thing to do. Meanwhile, Susie's classmates Ruth and Ray are present when Harvey drives up to dispose of the safe at a sinkhole dump site on the Conners' property. Susie returns to Earth and enters Ruth's body, causing Ruth to faint. Ray rushes to Ruth's aid only to realize she has become Susie. They kiss, completing Susie's last wish, and she returns to Heaven. Meanwhile, Harvey dumps the safe in the sinkhole, leaving it to disappear in the muddy water as he drives away. Sometime later, Harvey meets a young woman outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rejects him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an overhead branch, hitting Harvey's shoulder, causing him to fall backward over a steep cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as ""the lovely bones"" that grew around her absence. Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: ""My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for a moment and then I was gone. I wish you all a long and happy life""."
Batman,"As Gotham City approaches its bicentennial, Mayor Borg orders district attorney Harvey Dent and police Commissioner Gordon to make the city safer. Meanwhile, reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist Vicki Vale investigate rumors of a vigilante nicknamed ""Batman"" who is targeting the city's criminals. While hosting a fundraiser at his manor, billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne, who created Batman in the aftermath of his parents' murder during his childhood, meets with Vale during the event, but cuts short their meeting to secretly pursue Gordon, also attending, when he leaves on police business. Mob boss Carl Grissom, whom Dent and Gordon are targeting, sends his sociopathic second-in-command Jack Napier to raid Axis Chemicals, unaware it is a set-up aimed at having him murdered for sleeping with Grissom's mistress Alicia. Although corrupt police lieutenant Eckhardt arranges the hit on Napier by conducting an unauthorized police operation, Gordon arrives, takes command, and orders officers to capture him alive. When Batman arrives to prevent Napier's escape, Eckhardt is killed during the confrontation, while Napier himself falls into a vat of chemicals when attempting to attack Batman, and is presumed dead by all. However, Napier survives, but is left disfigured with chalk white skin, emerald green hair, and a rictus grin, resulting in him being driven insane and assuming the name of ""the Joker"". Joker murders Grissom for betraying him, takes over his criminal empire by murdering his syndicate members, and scars Alicia's face to equal his disfigurement. Batman begins working to find a way of stopping Joker when he begins terrorizing Gotham City through the use of hygiene products laced with ""Smylex"" - a deadly chemical which causes victims to die laughing with the same maniacal grin as the Joker. Joker soon becomes obsessed with Vicki and proceeds to lure her to the Gotham Museum of Art, where his henchmen destroy the works of art within. Batman arrives and rescues Vicki, escaping the Joker's men, before taking her to his Batcave, providing her with the information from his research on Smylex that will allow the city's residents to avoid exposure to the toxin. Conflicted with his love for her, Bruce attempts to explain about his alter-ego when visiting her at her apartment, only for Joker to interrupt the meeting. While Bruce avoids being killed with a serving tray, he realizes that Joker was the man who killed his parents, when he recognizes a question he uses from his childhood. Vicki finds herself taken to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, Alfred, who had been coaxing the relationship between the pair to bring out Bruce's human side. After exposing his secret to Vicki, Bruce reveals he cannot focus on their relationship with Joker on the loose, and departs to destroy the Axis plant used to create Smylex. Meanwhile, Joker proceeds to lure Gotham's citizens to a parade with the promise of free money, in order to dose them with Smylex gas held within giant parade balloons. Batman foils his plan by using his Batwing to remove the balloons. Joker proceeds to shoot down the Batwing, before capturing Vicki and taking her into a cathedral. Batman, surviving the crash, confronts him, saving Vicki, while proceeding to prevent Joker's escape by helicopter with a heavy granite gargoyle, causing him to fall to his death. Sometime later, Commissioner Gordon announces that the police have arrested the Joker's men and unveils the Bat-Signal. Harvey Dent reads a note from Batman, promising that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Vicki is taken to Wayne Manor by Alfred, who tells her that Bruce will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city."
House of Gucci,"In Italy 1978, Patrizia Reggiani is the office manager of her father's small trucking firm. At a party, she meets Maurizio Gucci, a law student and heir to a 50% interest in the Gucci fashion house through his father Rodolfo. Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio, charming him into love. Rodolfo warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after his wealth and tells him he will disinherit him if he marries Patrizia; Maurizio chooses her over his connection to Gucci, leaving the family. Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and he gets a job at the trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she considers her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation and lets that news slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo who gets delighted thereby and takes the couple under his wing. Aldo introduces Patrizia to his eccentric son Paolo, who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. Aldo helps Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will but fails to sign the document attesting him the 50% interest in Gucci shares before he dies, so Patrizia forges Rodolfo's signature on Rodolfo's updated testament. Patrizia devises a plot to obtain controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo's shares (the other 50%). She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap ""fake"" Gucci products on the black market, and consults Giuseppina ""Pina"", a psychic, for guidance on how to manipulate Maurizio, who has little real interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company. Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives this to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Patrizia lies to the Italian police that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark, so they stop his fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares, but he rebuffs and cuts ties with them. Italian police search Maurizio's, attempting to arrest him for forging Rodolfo's signature. His family flees to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi. After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia, he decides he is tired of his wife's influence on himself and the company. He  orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola, which Pina seemingly senses. When Maurizio's business plans harm Gucci's firm, he seeks assistance from an equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the firm from the now-impoverished Paolo. As Aldo returns from prison and realizes what Paolo has done, Investcorp offers to buy him out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal's instigator, whereupon Aldo sells his shares and cuts contact with Maurizio. Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, he asks her for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole, which she flatly refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming designer Tom Ford to revitalize the company's image through a new line. His products are successful, but Maurizio's poor management of Gucci compelled Investcorp's leaders to buy him out by 1995, replacing him with Tom and Domenico. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her assassinate him. Pina puts her in contact with two hitmen. A few days later, they shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his office. In the final scene, Patrizia takes her husband's last name when announcing herself before court, to stress that she still considers herself to be a Gucci even if the law does not. Closing intertitles describe the fate of the remaining characters:  Patrizia, Pina, and the hitmen are sentenced to various long prison terms, following their incriminating of murder. Aldo died of prostate cancer in 1990, while Paolo died in poverty, shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Gucci is fully acquired by Investcorp, and successfully managed the fashion Firm to its success and fame. None of its actual founders, of the Gucci family remained at the company."
The Iron Lady,"In flashbacks, the audience is shown a young Margaret Roberts working at the family grocer's shop in Grantham, listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolised –  it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife –  and announcing that she has won a place at Somerville College, Oxford. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle-class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Conservative Party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher's marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a ""Lady Member"" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath's Cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave, her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party and eventual victory, and her voice coaching and image change. Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister, after winning the 1979 general election, including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of ""wet"" members of her Cabinet – Ian Gilmour, Francis Pym, Michael Heseltine, and Jim Prior), the 1981 Brixton riot, the 1984–1985 UK miners' strike, and the bombing in Brighton of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and her husband were almost killed. We also see (slightly out of chronological sequence) her decision to retake the Falkland Islands following the islands' invasion by Argentina in 1982, the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano and Britain's subsequent victory in the Falklands War, her friendship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s. By 1990, Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her cabinet, refusing to accept that the ""Poll Tax"" is unjust, even while it is causing riots, and fiercely opposed to European integration. Her deputy, Geoffrey Howe, resigns after being humiliated by her in a cabinet meeting, Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership, and her loss of support from her cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but reluctantly to resign as Prime Minister after eleven years in office. A teary-eyed Thatcher exits 10 Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister with Denis comforting her. She is shown as still disheartened about it almost twenty years later. Eventually, Thatcher is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis' ghost leaves her as she cries that she actually is not yet ready to lose him, to which he replies ""You're going to be fine on your own... you always have been"" before leaving forever. Having finally overcome her grief, she contentedly washes a teacup alone in her kitchen."
Anthropoid,"In December 1941, German occupation in Europe has neared its height. Two agents from the Czechoslovak exile government, a Slovak soldier, Jozef Gabčík and  a Czech, Jan Kubiš are parachuted into their occupied country. Jozef is injured when he crashes through a tree upon landing, but both men set out to find their contact in the resistance movement. They are discovered shortly afterwards by fake resistance fighters who turn out to be traitors; one is shot by Jozef but the other man escapes. Stealing their truck, the agents head for Prague. When they seek out their contact, they are directed to Dr. Eduard, a veterinary surgeon who stitches Jozef's injuries. Eduard informs them their contact was arrested by the Gestapo and arranges for them to meet other resistance members, led by ""Uncle"" Jan Zelenka-Hajský and Ladislav Vaněk. Gabčík and Kubiš reveal that they are under orders to carry out ""Operation Anthropoid,"" the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the main architect of the Final Solution, and the Reichsprotektor of German–occupied Czechoslovakia. With limited sources of intelligence and equipment, Jozef and Jan must find a way to assassinate Heydrich, an operation which they hope will incite further Czech resistance against the occupation. With the help of two young women, Marie Kovárníková and Lenka Fafková, along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich along the route to his headquarters at Prague Castle. When the agents learn that Heydrich is about to be transferred to Paris, the plan goes into effect straightaway with the duo bolstered by the addition of other agents who have been parachuted into Czechoslovakia, and the remaining resistance fighters in Prague. On 27 May 1942 the assassination attempt is carried out; it nearly fails when Jozef's Sten submachine gun jams, but Heydrich is seriously wounded when Jan throws a  makeshift grenade which detonates under Heydrich's limousine before Jan and Jozef flee the scene.  In response to the attack, SS security forces round up thousands of Czech citizens and carry out reprisals, during which Lenka is killed trying to escape Nazi arrest. Heydrich dies from his injuries in hospital a few days later. Reprisals continue with the village of Lidice destroyed, its male population over the age of 16 summarily murdered, and the women and children sent to concentration camps. Fearing that his own family may fall victim to the reprisals, Resistance fighter Karel Čurda contacts Karl Hermann Frank, Heydrich's replacement as Reichsprotektor and betrays the others for amnesty and the reward being offered. The Moravec family who had sheltered Jozef and Jan while they planned the attack are arrested by the Gestapo. Marie Moravec commits suicide with a cyanide pill, but her son, Ata Moravec, is tortured by the Gestapo until he reveals Jozef and Jan's hiding place in a concealed basement of the Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague. Hundreds of troops storm the cathedral where all the Resistance agents hiding there, including Jozef and Jan, are killed in a fierce six hour battle, along with many German soldiers. Ultimately, a total of 5,000 Czechs and Slovaks were killed in the aftermath of the ""Heydrich Terror"". In response to the reprisals, Winston Churchill declares the 1938 Munich Agreement, which had allowed Germany to annex Czechoslovakia, null and void."
In the Valley of Elah,"On November 1, 2004, Hank Deerfield – a gravel trucker and retired military police sergeant living in Monroe, Tennessee with his wife Joan – is notified that his son Mike, a soldier recently returned from Iraq, has gone missing. Hank drives to Mike’s base in New Mexico to look for him; leaving home, he helps a school custodian raise the American flag correctly. At Fort Rudd, Hank meets his son’s squad, and secretly takes Mike’s cell phone from his belongings. Watching videos recovered from the phone, he attempts to report Mike’s disappearance to police detective Emily Sanders, after she finished talking to a woman whose dog has been murdered, regrettably unable to help out, and reaches out to a friend formerly at Army CID, without success. Mike’s burned and dismembered body is discovered. Fort Rudd claims jurisdiction, believing that a pipe found under Mike’s mattress and the recent arrest of other soldiers for smuggling heroin indicate his murder was drug-related. Hank persuades Sanders to show him the crime scene, and realizes that a green car spotted at the scene was actually blue. Belittled by her male colleagues, Sanders convinces the local sheriff to pursue the investigation, and Mike’s squadmate SPC Gordon Bonner reaches out to Hank. After viewing her son’s remains, Joan returns home and receives a package Mike mailed to himself, which Hank urges her not to open. Mike’s credit card history leads Sanders and Hank to a restaurant, where Hank deduces Mike ate with at least two other people shortly before his death. Sanders is given sworn statements from Mike’s squad by Army investigators, preventing her from interviewing them herself. She invites Hank over for dinner, and he tells her young son the story of the Biblical David’s battle with Goliath in the Valley of Elah. Eve, a topless bartender Hank previously questioned, recognizes Mike’s squadmate CPL Steve Penning from a photograph, leading Hank to learn that Mike and Penning were kicked out of a strip club the night Mike was killed. Sanders interviews Penning, Bonner, and SPC Ennis Long, who admit to lying in their statements: after Mike got the four of them kicked out of the club, he and Bonner fought in the parking lot; Mike then paid for their food at the restaurant, and they visited a prostitute before leaving Mike, who was looking to buy drugs. Hank refuses to believe Mike’s fellow soldiers could be involved in his death. Hank and the police determine that another member of Mike’s squad, PVT Robert Ortiz, is AWOL, with a history of drug smuggling and a blue car. Following the police as they raid Ortiz’s address, Hank subdues the fleeing Ortiz and beats him until detectives intervene. Ortiz is arrested, but Bonner is found hanged with Mike’s grandfather’s watch in his pocket. Sanders concludes that Bonner, who also owned a blue car, killed Mike. She learns that Angie, a soldier’s wife who came to her for help, has been murdered by her husband. Hank has his son’s remains sent home, and Penning helps jump-start his truck, reminiscing about Mike. Sanders matches Penning's handwriting to the signature on Mike’s last credit card statement, and realizes Penning, Bonner, and Long killed Mike, then used his credit card at the restaurant. Penning has already come forward and received a plea deal, but at Sanders’ insistence, she and Hank hear his confession in person: he admits to stabbing Mike after a seemingly insignificant quarrel. Hank asks him about a video of Mike torturing a captive insurgent, and the emotionally distant Penning explains, “We all do stupid things”. He also states that anyone could have died in that quarrel or a similar one, and that Mike ""was the smart one [and that] he could see"", thereby implying Mike may have brought the aggression upon himself out of nihilistic despondency and the realization of the group's inability to readjust to civilian life. Collecting Mike’s belongings, Hank apologizes to Ortiz, who has been honorably discharged. Haunted by his last conversation with his son, after Mike drove over an Iraqi child playing in the road, Hank thanks Sanders and returns home. He finds Joan opened Mike’s package, which contains a picture of his squad and a folded flag. Returning to the local school’s flagpole, Hank flies his son’s flag upside down."
Milk,"The film opens with archival footage of police raiding gay bars and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by Dianne Feinstein's November 27, 1978 announcement to the press that Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone had been assassinated. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith. Dissatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working-class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but he grows frustrated with Milk's devotion to politics and leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay ""establishment"", which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5, after a change from at-large elections to district elections. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and the third openly homosexual politician in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes. Milk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state senator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by Anita Bryant and her organization Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal a local gay rights ordinance. On November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. A desperate White favors a supervisor pay raise but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk. On the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters City Hall through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution-style. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a closeted gay man.The last scene is a candlelight vigil held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city. Pictures of the actual people depicted in the film, and brief summaries of their lives follow."
Dumb Money,"Keith Gill is a lower middle class man working as a financial analyst in Brockton, Massachusetts. During his spare time, he regularly frequents the stock market subreddit r/WallStreetBets, posting his opinions on it via YouTube live streams under the name Roaring Kitty. He struggles to provide for his family, and his YouTube work is constantly mocked by his brother Kevin as nerdy garbage. In July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Keith notices that video game retailer GameStop's stock is falling and sinks his life savings into buying stock in it, regularly live streaming updates with his viewers. Despite Kevin and several peers claiming this is a waste of time, by January 2021, activity on r/WallStreetBets reveals that several hedge fund investment firms, including Melvin Capital Management and its founder Gabe Plotkin, have been short selling stock in the chain on the assumption it would close, causing a mass increase in GameStop's overall stock price when online stock buyers, including struggling nurse Jennifer, GameStop retail employee Marcos, and lesbian college couple Riri and Harmony, start aggressively buying stock, causing Plotkin and other investment CEOs to lose hundreds of millions within the same timeframe and Keith to be heralded as a financial guru. Things take a turn when r/WallStreetBets is temporarily shut down for ""inflammatory and vulgar content"", causing a mass surge of panic selling in GameStop's stock in an attempt to beat a perceived price drop. When the commission-free stock trading website Robinhood is unable to adequately pay the money for the sales, co-chairman Vlad Tenev, at the behest of Citadel LLC owner Ken Griffin, halts all purchasing of GameStop's stock in an attempt to drive down the price. The play ultimately works, but the subsequent negative backlash results in an investigation by the United States House Committee on Financial Services, with Tenev, Griffin, Plotkin, and Keith all being subpoenaed, the former three for their roles in the fiasco and the latter on suspicion of using the situation to trick the public into making himself rich. As the investors struggle to defend their actions, Keith adamantly denies any wrongdoing, stating he was only doing what anyone with a passing awareness of investment banking would do in that situation. In the aftermath, post text shows how several of the individuals were affected: Plotkin was forced to shut down Melvin Capital because of the net losses the incident caused; Robinhood was the target of several lawsuits following the fiasco and wound up starting in the stock market significantly lower than it was prior; Harmony was able to use the money she obtained to pay off her family's debt issues and continues her relationship with Riri; Marcos sold half of his GameStop stock and quit his position in the company; Jennifer remains in debt but has retained her shareholding; Keith retired from YouTube in late April to get out of the public eye and sold part of his stocks to get Kevin an expensive car as a way to stop his nagging about how he will not loan him his car for his food deliveries."
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"In 2127, Dr. Paul Merchant, an engineer, seals himself in a room aboard The Minos, a space station that he designed. As armed guards attempt to break through the door, Merchant manipulates a robot into solving the Lament Configuration, destroying the robot in the process. The guards break through the door and apprehend Merchant, who agrees to explain his motivations to their leader, Rimmer. The film flashes back to Paris, France, 1796. Dr. Merchant's ancestor, Phillip LeMarchand, a French toymaker, makes the Lament Configuration on commission from the libertine aristocrat Duc de L'Isle. Unbeknownst to LeMarchand, L'Isle's specifications for the box make it a portal to Hell. Upon delivering the box to L'Isle, LeMarchand watches as he and his assistant Jacques sacrifice a peasant girl and use her flayed-off skin to summon a demon, Angelique, through the box. LeMarchand runs home in terror, where he begins working on blueprints for a second box which will neutralize the effects of the first. Returning to L'Isle's mansion to steal the box, LeMarchand discovers that Jacques has killed L'Isle and taken control over Angelique, who agrees to be his slave so long as he does not impede the wishes of Hell. The pair kill LeMarchand, and Jacques informs him that his bloodline is now cursed for helping to open a portal to Hell. In 1996, LeMarchand's descendant, John Merchant, has built a skyscraper in Manhattan that resembles the Lament Configuration. Seeing an article on the building in a magazine, Angelique asks Jacques to take her to the United States so that she can confront him. When Jacques denies her request, Angelique kills him, as Merchant poses a threat to Hell. Angelique travels to the United States, where she fails to seduce Merchant. Discovering the Lament Configuration in the building's foundation, Angelique tricks a security guard into solving it, which summons Pinhead. The two immediately clash, as Pinhead represents a shift in the ideologies of Hell, which she left behind two hundred years ago: while Angelique believes in corrupting people through temptation, Pinhead is fanatically devoted to pain and suffering. Despite their conflicting views, the pair forge an uneasy alliance to kill Merchant before he can complete the Elysium Configuration, an anti-Lament Configuration that creates perpetual light and would serve to permanently close all gateways to Hell. Angelique and Pinhead initially collaborate to corrupt Merchant, but Pinhead grows tired of Angelique's seductive techniques and threatens to kill Merchant's wife and child. Having grown accustomed to a decadent life on Earth, Angelique wants no part of Hell's new fanatical austerity, and she intends to force Merchant to activate the Elysium Configuration and destroy Hell, thus freeing her from its imperatives. However, Merchant's flawed prototype fails. Pinhead kills Merchant, but his wife opens Angelique's Lament Configuration, sending Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell. In 2127, Rimmer disbelieves Dr. Merchant's story and has him locked away. Pinhead and his followers - now including an enslaved Angelique - have already been freed after Merchant opened the box. Upon learning of Dr. Merchant's intentions, they kill the entire crew of the ship, save for Rimmer and Dr. Merchant, who escape. Dr. Merchant reveals that the Minos is, in fact, the final, perfected form of the Elysium Configuration, and that by activating it, he can kill Pinhead and permanently seal the gateway to Hell. Dr. Merchant distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he boards an escape pod with Rimmer. Once clear of the station, he activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, killing Pinhead and his followers, thus ending Pinhead's existence, this time, permanently."
House of 1000 Corpses,"On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, Captain Spaulding, and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of ""The Museum of Monsters & Madmen"", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited hitchhiker named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home. There they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother Otis Driftwood, her deformed giant half-brother Tiny, Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as scarecrows, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially scalped for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star. When Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later. Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of mental patients; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being vivisected and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror."
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"Many years after the previous film, Freddy Krueger has returned and killed nearly every child and teenager in the town of Springwood, Ohio. The only surviving teenager, John Doe, is confronted by Freddy in a dream. John wakes up just outside the Springwood city limits but, due to a head injury, does not remember who he is or why he is there. At a shelter for troubled youth, three of the residents—Spencer, Carlos, and Tracy—plot to run away to California. The police find John and take him to the shelter, where he becomes a patient of Dr. Maggie Burroughs. Burroughs notices a newspaper clipping from Springwood in John's pocket. To attempt to cure John's amnesia, she plans a road trip to Springwood. In an attempt to run away, Tracy, Carlos, and Spencer stow away in the van, but they are discovered when John has a hallucination and almost wrecks the van just outside Springwood. Tracy, Spencer, and Carlos try to leave Springwood but first rest at a nearby abandoned house. The house is 1428 Elm Street, Freddy Krueger's former home. John and Maggie visit the Springwood orphanage and discover that Freddy had a child. John believes he is that child, because Freddy allowed him to live. Back on Elm Street, Carlos and Spencer fall asleep and are killed by Freddy. Tracy is almost killed, but is awakened by Burroughs. John, who went into the dream world with Tracy to try to help Spencer, is still asleep. Burroughs and Tracy take John back to the shelter. On their way back, Krueger attacks John in his dream. Before killing John, Krueger reveals that his child is a girl; as John dies, he tells this to Burroughs. Tracy and Burroughs return to the shelter, but they find that no one remembers John, Spencer, or Carlos except for Doc, who has learned to control his dreams. Burroughs finds her adoption papers and realizes that she is Freddy's daughter. Her birth name was Katherine Krueger. Her name was changed to Maggie Burroughs when her father was arrested and subsequently murdered. Doc discovers that Freddy's power comes from dream demons who continually revive him, and that Freddy can be killed if he is pulled into the real world. Burroughs decides that she will be the one to enter Freddy's mind and pull him into the real world. Once in the dream world, she puts on a pair of 3D glasses and enters Freddy's mind. In his mind, she learns that Freddy was teased as a child, was abused by his foster father, inflicted self-abuse as a teenager (portrayed by Tobe Sexton), and murdered his wife. Freddy was given the power to become immortal by fiery demons. Burroughs struggles to pull Freddy into the real world but eventually succeeds. Burroughs and Freddy end up in hand-to-hand combat against one another; she uses several weapons confiscated from patients at the shelter. Enraged by the knowledge of what he has done, Burroughs tears off Freddy's clawed glove and stabs him through the stomach with it, embedding the glove's claws into a steel support beam and leaving Freddy suspended above the ground. Tracy tosses Maggie a pipe bomb which Burroughs throws into Freddy's chest. She says ""Happy Father's Day"", kisses him, and runs. The three dream demons fly out of Freddy after the pipe bomb kills him. Burroughs smiles at Tracy and Doc; she is confident that her father is dead."
Cherry Falls,"In the woods outside of Cherry Falls, Virginia, a teenage couple, Rod Harper (Jesse Bradford) and Stacy Twelfmann (Bre Blair) are getting romantic in a car when a black-haired female appears and murders them both. Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken (Brittany Murphy), the daughter of the local sheriff, is with her boyfriend, Kenny (Gabriel Mann), who thinks it is time to ""see other people."" Jody goes back home to find her father, Brent (Michael Biehn), upset that she is out past her curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the murders the next day. They see that the killer carved the word ""virgin"" into both victims. At school, Brent sees English teacher Mr. Leonard Marliston (Jay Mohr), who urges him to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets. Annette Duwald, also a virgin, is home alone when she is killed in the same manner as the other two teenagers. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. No students are invited, but Jody and her friend Timmy, who stayed after school, witness the meeting. Timmy asks to borrow Jody's cell phone, and goes into the stairwell to make a call. Jody goes downstairs to find him, and discovers his dead body in a locker room. She is confronted by the killer who attacks her, but she manages to escape. At the police station, Jody describes the killer to an officer, who draws a composite. Brent confides with an old friend, Tom Sisler, (the current high school principal) that the suspect looks like ""Lora Lee Sherman.""  The two are both visibly nervous, and Jody listens in on their conversation. Back at school, Jody and Kenny reconcile. Later Jody learns from her mother about the tale of Lora Lee. Twenty-seven years ago, Lora Lee was a high school loner. She claimed that four popular boys at school, including Brent and the high school principal, raped her one night. Her cries fell on deaf ears and she left the city for the rural outskirts, where she was rarely seen or heard from again. After Jody discovers the truth, disappointed with the hypocrisy of her parents, she visits Kenny at his house. They talk and Jody, being upset with her parents, tries to have sex with Kenny. He refuses, causing her to get upset and leave. After catching news of the killer's targeting of virgins, the high school students in town congregate at an abandoned hunting lodge to indulge in a mass orgy. Brent goes to the school to meet Sisler only to find the principal dead in his office with the words ""virgin not"" carved into his forehead. Before Brent can react he is knocked out by the killer. Jody, who has refused to attend the orgy with Kenny, is out riding her bike when she cycles by Mr. Marliston's house and witnesses him dragging a heavy trunk inside. She helps him get it into the house, and he casually mentions that her father is inside it. She opens it and finds her father, beaten and bloody, before she is knocked unconscious. At the orgy, Kenny is about to have sex with a girl when he has second thoughts and leaves to find Jody. Driving around, he is puzzled to see her bicycle outside of Marliston's house. In his basement, Marliston puts on a wig and makeup to ""become"" Lora Lee Sherman. Marliston reveals that he is Lora Lee Sherman's illegitimate son, and asks Brent to retell the story of what happened that night 25 years ago. Brent reveals that the four boys, including himself, did indeed rape Lora Lee. Marliston says his mother became an abusive ""psycho"" after the rape and that one of the rapists is his father; there is an implication that Brent is in fact Marliston's biological father. By targeting virgins, Marliston would rob all the wealthy parents of their ""precious virginal children"". Kenny enters the house and frees Jody as Brent fights with Marliston, who manages to brutally kill him. Jody and Kenny flee to the orgy with Marliston in furious pursuit, killing a deputy en route. He bursts inside wielding an axe and mass panic erupts. After wildly stabbing panicking students and then trying to escape, Marliston fights both Jody and Kenny, with Kenny being severely wounded during the melee. Eventually, Marliston is pushed off a balcony by Jody and impaled on fence posts. At first he seems to be dead, before reviving briefly only to be promptly shot dead by Deputy Sheriff Mina, who unloads two pistols into him. The next day, Jody hides the reasons for the killings from the police and she and her mother head away from the station. As they leave town, Jody sees someone resembling Lora Lee Sherman disappear behind a moving school bus. The film ends with a shot of the waterfalls outside town, turning red."
Jaws 2,"Prior to a new hotel opening on Amity Island, a gigantic great white shark ambushes and kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the Orca. Their camera, which triggered during the attack, is recovered. The shark then swiftly kills a female water skier. The driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills the driver and severely burns the right side of the shark's face. A killer whale carcass bearing fatal wounds is found beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible for these events. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who doubts that the town has another shark problem. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is unavailable due to being in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody grounds his son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach, much to Mike's dismay. The following day, Brody watches from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it with his gun. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. Presenting it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief with the sole dissent coming from the Mayor. The next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends, taking his younger brother Sean with him to keep him silent. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenagers Tina and Eddie, who have strayed away from the others; Eddie falls into the water and is killed by the shark. Brody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him underwater. Former deputy Len Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat (aided by a reluctant Hendricks) to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the bow, and she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes on to find the kids. Meanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other in the ensuing chaos. Mike is knocked unconscious and nearly killed. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy barely pull him out and leave the others to take him ashore and get help, while Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper, capsizing it and drowning the pilot. It then knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is killed while saving him. Brody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation and apologizes for not knowing about the shark; Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety, then finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing him to maroon the police boat. He tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next move sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction, while Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean are still on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark towards him, holding the cable out in front of him. The shark bites the cable, getting electrocuted to death. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue."
When a Stranger Calls,"Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) is babysitting the children of Dr. Mandrakis (Carmen Argenziano) at his home. When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. Jill initially dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who tell Jill to keep the caller on the line long enough for them to trace the call. Jill receives one final call from her stalker. Immediately after the conversation, the police phone to inform her that the calls are coming from a phone inside the house. Jill runs to the door as a light comes on at the top of the staircase, and the stalker's shadow appears. The scene segues to a close-up of detective John Clifford (Charles Durning), who is the investigating the matter. Patrol officer Charlie Garber (Ron O'Neal) explains that Jill is unharmed, but the children were murdered by the perpetrator several hours earlier, before Jill's ordeal even started. The killer is identified as an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley), who is subsequently sent to an asylum. Seven years later, Duncan escapes from the asylum. Dr. Mandrakis hires Clifford, now a private investigator, to find Duncan. Not knowing Clifford is after him, Duncan is now a homeless, vagrant loner. He is beaten after disturbing a woman, Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), in a downtown bar, and later follows her to her apartment. Feeling sorry for his appearance and her involuntary role in the beating, Tracy tries to be nice to the man while getting him to leave, hoping this will be the last she sees of him. Meanwhile, an increasingly obsessed Clifford confides to his friend (now Lieutenant) Garber his intention to kill Duncan rather than arrest him. Garber, who was also present in the Mandrakis crime scene, agrees to collaborate. Clifford follows the trail to the bar where Duncan was beaten, and from there to Tracy's residence. Clifford tells Tracy just how dangerous her situation has become, revealing that Duncan had literally torn apart the Mandrakis children with his bare hands. Tracy reluctantly agrees to be Clifford's bait at the bar that evening should Duncan reappear. Clifford surreptitiously follows Tracy from the bar to her apartment, but sees no sign of Duncan.  After Clifford leaves, however, Duncan comes out of hiding from inside Tracy’s closet. Tracy screams for help. Clifford returns and chases Duncan away from the scene, losing his trail in the streets of downtown Los Angeles. Jill Lockart (née Johnson) is now married with two young children. One night, she and her husband Stephen (Steven Anderson) go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion, while their children are babysat by Sharon (Lenora May). At the restaurant, Jill gets a telephone call and hears Duncan's voice again: ""Have you checked the children?"". She panics and calls Sharon; nothing seems to be wrong at first, but then the call is suddenly disconnected. The police escort Jill back home to discover that everything there is fine. Clifford is tipped off by Garber, however, and tries to call Jill, but finds that the line is disconnected. Later that night, Jill goes downstairs for a glass of milk when the lights suddenly go out. She returns to bed and hears Duncan's voice as the closet door appears to open. Jill tries shaking her husband awake only to realize that the man lying next to her is Duncan. Duncan chases Jill across the room and attempts to kill when Clifford arrives and fatally shoots Duncan. Jill’s husband Stephen is revealed to be in the closet, unconscious but alive. Their children are safe. As Clifford comforts Jill, the last view is of the house, superimposed beneath the eyes of Curt Duncan."

Jersey Boys,"In Belleville, New Jersey in 1951, Tommy DeVito performs together with his brother Nicky, and their friend Nick Massi, as The Variety Trio. He meets 16-year-old Frankie Castelluccio, a barber's son, already well known in the neighborhood for his singing voice. Frankie has the admiration of Genovese Family mobster Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo, who takes a personal interest in him. One night, the group attempts a robbery of a safe, resulting in the police later arresting them. In court, Frankie is let off with a slap on the wrist, while Tommy is sentenced to six months in prison. After his release, Tommy reunites with the group, and adds Frankie as lead singer. Frankie changes his professional name to Frankie Vally, and then Frankie Valli. At a performance, Frankie is entranced by a woman named Mary Delgado. He takes her to dinner, and they are soon married. The group, now called ""The Four Lovers"", is in need of a songwriter after Nicky leaves. Tommy's friend, Joe Pesci, tells him about a talented singer-songwriter, Bob Gaudio, and invites him to hear the group perform. Gaudio is impressed with Valli's vocals, and agrees to join. The band, having recorded several demos, attempts to attract interest, but has little success. One day, in New York City, producer Bob Crewe signs them to a contract. However, they quickly realize that it only allows them to perform back-up vocals for other acts. Crewe says that the group does not have a distinctive image or sound yet. Inspired by a bowling alley sign, the band is renamed ""The Four Seasons,"" and they sing a new song Gaudio has written, ""Sherry"", to Crewe, who agrees to record it. ""Sherry"" quickly becomes a commercial success, followed by two more, ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"". However, before an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Valli is approached by mobster Norman Waxman, a loan shark for one of the other Five Families, who claims that Tommy owes him $150,000. Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mob's associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommy's irresponsibility, not being involved in the group's decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group. Having to tour constantly to pay off the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now ex-wife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her. A few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommy's debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francine's death by drug overdose. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"", becomes a commercial success. In 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band performs ""Rag Doll"" onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has gone on to become an Oscar-winning actor (his award-winning role was a fictionalized account of another real-life gangster coincidentally also named Tommy DeVito). Nick claims to have no regrets about leaving the group, enjoying the time he spends with his family. Frankie is still touring through his solo career, but yearns for the days he performed with the rest. Bob has retired to Nashville, Tennessee.  Frankie states that the best time he had during his time with the Four Seasons was before their success, ""four guys under a streetlamp, when it was all still ahead of us."""
Bohemian Rhapsody,"In 1985, Queen wait to perform at Live Aid. Fifteen years earlier, in 1970, Farrokh Bulsara works as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport and lives with his parents and sister. He goes to a pub to see the band Smile perform. Seeking them out after the show, he meets and is attracted to Mary Austin, who works at the boutique Biba. He finds drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May and learns that their lead singer and bassist, Tim Staffell, has just quit to join Humpy Bong. Farrokh offers himself as a replacement singer and impresses them with his vocal ability. Farrokh seeks out Mary at Biba and they start dating. The band plays gigs across Britain with Farrokh as the lead singer and new bassist John Deacon. Farrokh pushes them to think bigger and sells their van to finance a record album.

In 1975, Queen record their fourth studio album, A Night at the Opera, placing extensive effort into recording Freddie's magnum opus, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". However, they quit EMI when executive Ray Foster refuses to release it as the album's lead single. Freddie conspires with radio DJ Kenny Everett to debut the song on his program. Despite critical pans, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" becomes a global hit, launching Queen to international superstardom. Following a world tour, Freddie begins an affair with Paul and comes out to Mary as bisexual. She counters that he is gay and they call off the engagement but remain close friends. The band's success continues into the 1980s with the songs ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Another One Bites the Dust"", but tensions arise over Paul's influence on Freddie. At a lavish party at his home, Freddie is attracted to a waiter, Jim Hutton, who tells Freddie to find him when he learns self-acceptance. Paul encourages Reid to persuade Freddie to go solo, but when the idea offends Freddie, Paul feigns ignorance and Freddie fires Reid without consulting the band. Freddie's relationship with the band further deteriorates after the campy music video for ""I Want to Break Free"", where the band appears in drag, backfires and he signs a $4-million solo deal with CBS Records, effectively breaking up the band. He records his 1984 solo album Mr. Bad Guy in Munich and engages in drugs and gay orgies with Paul, but starts to feel unwell. Mary, now married and pregnant, visits unexpectedly and urges him to return to Queen and participate in the benefit concert Live Aid. Realizing that Paul withheld news of Live Aid from him and has been a corrosive influence, Freddie fires him. In retaliation, Paul goes public about Freddie's sexual escapades. Freddie returns to London to reconcile with the band and persuade them to play at Live Aid as a last-minute addition. He learns that he has AIDS and reveals his condition to the band, but brushes off their sympathy, wishing to focus on performing and making music for however long he has left. The band embraces in solidarity. On the day of Live Aid, Freddie reconnects with Jim Hutton, Mary, and his family, and heeds his father's Zoroastrian maxim, ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds"". Freddie and the band are in top form at Live Aid, performing several hits including ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Radio Ga Ga"", and ""We Are the Champions"", and helping to increase donations. A series of intertitles recount Freddie's final years with Mary and Jim, his death in 1991 at age 45, and the establishment of the Mercury Phoenix Trust by the band and their lawyer-turned-manager Jim ""Miami"" Beach."

Al catches the interest of Dr. Demento, who offers to be his manager while suggesting he go by the stage name ""Weird Al"". At a party hosted by Dr. Demento, the doctor's rival Wolfman Jack dares Al to prove himself by parodying Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"" with bassist John Deacon present. Al comes up with ""Another One Rides the Bus"", impressing the celebrities in attendance. Al lands his record contract, and his debut album goes multi-platinum, with the original artists experiencing a ""Yankovic bump"" in record sales and Al being feted by Oprah Winfrey. Al calls home to find his father is still dismissive of him. Dr. Demento suggests Al try to make his own original song, which he refuses. However, after Dr. Demento gives him guacamole laced with LSD, Al comes up with an original new song, which becomes his next hit, ""Eat It"". Madonna, in search of the ""Yankovic bump"", begins a relationship with Al to convince him to parody her song ""Like a Virgin"", though he insists he now only writes original songs. Dr. Demento and Al's bandmates warn him that Madonna is a bad influence, but they continue their romance. Just before a major show, Al learns that Michael Jackson has taken ""Eat It"" and parodied it as ""Beat It"", which angers him since he believes people will assume ""Eat It"" is a parody of ""Beat It"". An intoxicated Al suffers a near-fatal car accident and is rushed to the hospital, where he comes up with ""Like a Surgeon"" after regaining consciousness. He premieres the song at a show that same night, while still heavily injured, but when he is reminded that ""Eat It"" is the last song for the show, he gets drunk on stage, insults the crowd, and is arrested for lewdness. Once released, Al confesses to Madonna that he fears he has alienated everybody who cared about him and that she is the only one he has left. Suddenly, Madonna is captured by agents of Pablo Escobar, who is a huge fan of Al and uses the kidnapping to coerce him to play at his 40th birthday party. Al flies to Colombia and goes on a rampage to break into Escobar's compound, where he confronts the drug lord. After refusing to play a song for him, he gets into a shootout and kills Escobar and his mercenaries to free Madonna. With the kingpin dead, Madonna tries to talk Al into giving up music and helping her take over his drug empire, but Al rejects her. Al returns home to work in his father's factory, as his father had always wanted; but Al's father admits that Al never belonged in that line of work and that he had secretly supported Al's chosen path all along. The elder Yankovic reveals he grew up in an Amish community and was excommunicated for taking up the accordion, prompting him to prevent Al from making the same mistake. Al then brings his father's song, ""Amish Paradise"", to the stage, winning him a major award in 1985 before being assassinated onstage by one of Madonna's henchmen. Madonna later visits Weird Al's grave before being grabbed by a zombified Al."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,"In 1957, Billie Holiday meets with a radio journalist, Reginald Lord Devine, for an interview. He asks her what it is like to be a ""colored woman"" and about the trouble she keeps getting into because of her hit song ""Strange Fruit"". Billie says it is about human rights, something the government often forgets. In 1947, Billie's husband Monroe and her manager Joe Glaser try to get Billie to cut ""Strange Fruit"" from her set list, saying people high up in the government do not want to hear her sing it. Lester Young, Billie's sax player, supports her in playing it. In the 1940s, FBN chief Harry J. Anslinger tells agents that Billie is a threat, her song promotes the wrong ideas, and she has not stopped singing it. Unable to arrest her for singing, they decide to go after her on drug charges. After Billie's next show, Agent Jimmy Fletcher, disguised as a soldier, witnesses her doing drugs. The FBI arrest Billie and her lover Joe Guy for drug use and possession. The judge sentences Billie to a year in jail. It is later revealed that Anslinger paid off Guy. Anslinger tells Jimmy that they need to make sure Billie never sings again. Jimmy questions why Billie is such a problem. Anslinger tells Fletcher to go to the prison to get back in with Billie. Instead, he tells her to not trust anyone and warns her the FBI will continue to try to set her up. After Billie is released from prison, she does a Carnegie Hall show, where an audience member asks her to sing ""Strange Fruit"" and she sadly declines. Billie meets John Levy, who tells her that he will pay off the right people to make sure she can keep singing in his clubs. They begin a relationship. Levy proposes to her, then slips drugs into her pocket just in time for the FBI to enter. In court, Fletcher admits that Billie was possibly framed, and she is freed. Anslinger sends Fletcher to follow Billie on her tour. In 1949, Jimmy comes to see Billie after a successful tour stop and tells her the agency wants her to think he was fired. Suspicious, the whole crew has Jimmy do heroin to show he can be trusted. Over the course of the tour, Jimmy and Billie fall in love. One day, after the bus breaks down, Billie breaks up with Jimmy, telling him he needs to find a nice girl, and that is not her. Jimmy returns to work, where he finds he has been replaced. Billie marries Louis McKay, later returning to Jimmy. Later, Billie tells Jimmy she has liver failure. In the hospital, Anslinger tells Billie and McKay that if she cooperates, she will never see them again. Billie tells him that his grandkids will be singing ""Strange Fruit"" one day."
Sister Act,"In 1968, Deloris Wilson is a young Catholic school student. In 1992, the adult Deloris is a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada, performing as “Deloris Van Cartier”. After Deloris witnesses her gangster boyfriend Vince LaRocca execute an informant, police lieutenant Eddie Souther places her in witness protection. She is brought to Saint Katherine's Parish, a convent in a run-down San Francisco neighborhood. The Reverend Mother reluctantly agrees to shelter Deloris, as the police will pay the failing convent. Disguised as “Sister Mary Clarence”, Deloris struggles with convent life, and sneaks out to a bar, followed by nuns Mary Patrick and Mary Robert. They are caught, and the Reverend Mother forces Deloris to join the convent choir. With her singing experience, Deloris transforms the struggling choir. At Sunday Mass, Deloris leads the much-improved choir in a traditional performance of ""Hail Holy Queen"", before shifting into a gospel and rock-and-roll interpretation. Although the Reverend Mother is infuriated, Monsignor O'Hara congratulates the choir's unorthodox performance for attracting people to the service. Convinced by Deloris, he allows the nuns to clean up the church and the neighborhood. The choir continues to amaze parishioners and visitors with a rendition of ""My Guy"" – rewritten as ""My God"" – and the nuns attract media attention for revitalizing the neighborhood. Souther chastises Deloris for nearly being exposed on national television, as Vince has placed a bounty on her head. O'Hara informs the convent that Pope John Paul II, having heard of the choir’s success, will visit the church himself. Deloris tells the Reverend Mother that Vince’s upcoming trial means she will soon leave, and the Reverend Mother reveals she has resigned, believing she is no longer of use to the convent. Souther discovers a corrupt detective in his own department has given Deloris’ location to Vince, and rushes to San Francisco to warn Deloris, but she is kidnapped by Vince’s men. The Reverend Mother reveals Deloris’ identity to the nuns, and they decide to go after her, guilting a helicopter pilot into flying them to Reno. There, Vince orders his men to kill Deloris, but they are reluctant to shoot her while she is dressed as a nun. Arriving at Vince's casino, the nuns find Deloris after she escapes from Vince’s men. They become trapped in the casino lounge, and Deloris prepares to sacrifice herself. Before Vince can shoot her, Souther arrives and arrests Vince and his men. Thanking Deloris for what she has done, the Reverend Mother decides to remain at the convent. Returning to San Francisco, the choir, led by Deloris, sing ""I Will Follow Him"" to a packed audience in Saint Katherine's, receiving a standing ovation from all, including the Pope."
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,"The film is divided into two separate, unequal stories. In the shorter of the two, Holmes is approached by a famous Russian ballerina, Madame Petrova (Tamara Toumanova), who proposes that they conceive a child together, one who she hopes will inherit her physique and his intellect. Holmes manages to extricate himself by claiming that Watson is his lover, much to the doctor's embarrassment. Back at 221B, Watson confronts Holmes about the reality of the ensuing rumours, and Holmes only states that Watson is ""being presumptuous"" by assuming Holmes has had relationships with women. In the main plot, a Belgian woman, Gabrielle Valladon (Geneviève Page), is fished out of the River Thames and brought to Baker Street. She begs Holmes to find her missing engineer husband. The resulting investigation leads to a castle in Scotland. Along the way, they encounter a group of monks and some dwarfs, and Watson apparently sights the Loch Ness monster. It turns out that Sherlock's brother Mycroft (Christopher Lee) is involved in building a pre-World War I submarine for the British Navy, with the assistance of Monsieur Valladon.  When taken out for testing, it was disguised as a sea monster. The dwarfs were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. When they meet, Mycroft informs Sherlock that his client is actually a top German spy, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, sent to steal the submersible. The ""monks"" are German sailors. Queen Victoria (Mollie Maureen) arrives for an inspection of the new weapon, but objects to its unsportsmanlike nature. She orders the exasperated Mycroft to destroy it, so he conveniently leaves it unguarded for the monks to take (rigging it to sink when it is submerged). Fräulein von Hoffmanstal is arrested, to be exchanged for her British counterpart. In the final scene some months later, Sherlock receives a message from his brother, telling him that von Hoffmanstal had been arrested as a spy in Japan, and subsequently executed by firing squad. Heartbroken, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in a 7% solution of cocaine."
Murder on the Orient Express,"In 1934, famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot solves a theft at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The obsessive-compulsive Poirot— had intended to rest in Istanbul but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the Simplon-route Orient Express service, arranges Poirot's accommodations aboard the train. Other passengers include American widow Caroline Hubbard, American businessman Edward Ratchett, Ratchett's English manservant Edward Masterman and his secretary/translator Hector MacQueen; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; physician John Arbuthnot; Mary Debenham, a governess; Pilar Estravados, a Spanish missionary; Cuban-American car salesman Biniamino Marquez; and Gerhard Hardman, an Austrian university professor. Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received anonymous threatening letters, but Poirot declines. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers until a rescue engine can arrive. During the night, Poirot is awakened by strange noises in Ratchett's compartment that is next to his. Immediately after, he sees someone in a red kimono rushing down the aisleway. Ratchett is found murdered the next morning, stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers. Evidence indicates one person murdered Ratchett. Mrs. Hubbard claims a man was in her compartment during the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to Daisy Armstrong, a small child who was kidnapped and then murdered after her wealthy family paid the ransom. Ratchett's true identity is John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of Daisy's death caused her pregnant mother, Sonia, to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, was overcome with grief and committed suicide. The family's nursemaid, Susanne, was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her arrest and subsequent suicide while in police custody. More evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, a conductor's uniform button. Poirot finds the uniform and the red kimono planted in his suitcase. Hubbard is stabbed, non-fatally, in the back, but she cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing Debenham, Poirot is shot in the shoulder by Dr. Arbuthnot, who claims responsibility for the murder, but Bouc prevents him killing Poirot. However, Poirot realises that Arbuthnot, a former army sniper, never intended to kill him. Poirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories on Cassetti's death. The first is simple but does not fit all the facts: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, then fled the train. The second theory is more complex: every suspect is connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or to her trial. All had a motive to murder Cassetti: MacQueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case. He was pressured into prosecuting Susanne and sending her to prison, only for his career to be destroyed after she was exonerated following her suicide Masterman, who is terminally ill, was Colonel Armstrong's batman during the war, later his valet and also as butler to the Armstrong household Dr. Arbuthnot was Colonel Armstrong's comrade and best friend Countess Andrenyi (née Goldenberg and real name Helena) was Sonia Armstrong's sister and Daisy's aunt Count Andrenyi was Sonia's brother-in-law Princess Dragomiroff was Daisy’s godmother, and a friend of her grandmother Ms Debenham was Sonia's secretary and Daisy's governess Schmidt was the Armstrong's cook Marquez was the Armstrong's chauffeur Estravados was Daisy's nurse Hardman, whose real name is Cyrus and is American, is a former policeman in love with Susanne Pierre Michel, the train's conductor, was Susanne's brother Hubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, as well as Sonia's mother and Daisy's grandmother.Poirot concludes they acted together, which Hubbard confirms, admitting she planned the murder and recruited the others to participate. Each co-conspirator and Michel stabbed Cassetti in turn. Debenham wore the kimono and Arbuthnot superficially stabbed Hubbard to convince Poirot there was a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun to prevent him from exposing their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and attempts suicide, but it is empty; Poirot was testing the suspects' reactions. With the locomotive back on the tracks, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in this case, as Cassetti deserved death. For the first time, Poirot must live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the Yugoslavian police, allowing the others to remain on the train. As he disembarks, a British Army messenger delivers a note asking him to investigate a death on the Nile. Poirot accepts the case."
Hardcore,"Jake Van Dorn is a prosperous local businessman in Grand Rapids, Michigan who has strong Calvinist convictions. A single parent, Van Dorn is the father of a seemingly quiet, conservative girl, Kristen, who inexplicably disappears when she goes on a church-sponsored trip to Bellflower, California. Andy Mast, a strange private investigator (PI) from Los Angeles, is then hired to find her, eventually turning up an 8mm stag film of Van Dorn's daughter with two young guys. After Van Dorn views the film, he suspects that his daughter was kidnapped and persuaded to join California's porn underworld. His quest to rescue her takes him on an odyssey through this sleazy subculture. With no results from the PI, the Los Angeles Police Department, or even from Los Angeles' sex shopkeepers and ""rap parlor"" women, a desperate Van Dorn posts an ad as a pornography producer in the Los Angeles Free Press, hoping to find information about his daughter. A scraggly actor named ""Jism Jim"", who was in the film with Kristen, knows where she might be and sends him to a sometime porn actress/hooker named Niki. Van Dorn hires Niki to accompany him on the search for Kristen. Chasing a rumor that Kristen was now filming porn in Mexico, their uneasy alliance moves from Los Angeles to San Diego, gradually warming up to each other: Niki feels protected by Van Dorn because he is a man who doesn't see her as merely a sex object, and he is able to speak openly to her about his deepest feelings, such as his wife leaving him. The unlikely pair ends in San Francisco where Van Dorn finds that Kristen may be in the hands of Ratan, a very dangerous S & M porn player who deals in the world of ""snuff movies"". Niki, who had previously begun to think Van Dorn will help her to escape life on the streets, now finds herself fearful of being forgotten once he locates his daughter at all—alive or dead. As a result, she initially refuses to divulge the address of a porn industry player who is a link to Ratan. Van Dorn loses his temper and strikes her to get her to reveal the information. Van Dorn finds the player, ""Tod"", in a bondage house and forces Tod to tell him where Ratan hangs out. Van Dorn and Mast track Ratan to a nightclub where he and Kristen are observing a live sex show. When Van Dorn confronts Ratan, Kristen flees and Ratan slashes Van Dorn with a knife. Mast shoots and kills Ratan. Van Dorn tells Kristen he'll take her home from the people he believes forced her into pornography. However, she responds with anger, stating that she entered porn of her own free will as a way to rebel against her conservative upbringing and now felt loved and appreciated in a way that the emotionally distant Van Dorn never offered. Despondent and tearful, Van Dorn asks her if she really wants him to leave her alone but she acknowledges that she does not. As the two prepare to return home, Van Dorn spots Niki. He speaks to her, starting to make a token offer of gratitude but it's clear to both that it's just as she feared—her usefulness to him, and thus their relationship, is now over. She walks away, resigned to continuing her life on the streets."
Blue Velvet,"College student Jeffrey Beaumont returns home to Lumberton, North Carolina, after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. Walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. After eavesdropping on her father discussing the ear with a colleague, Sandy tells Jeffrey that it somehow relates back to a lounge singer named Dorothy Vallens. Intrigued, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator and steals a spare key while she's distracted by a man in a distinctive yellow sport coat, whom Jeffrey takes to calling ""The Yellow Man"". Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings ""Blue Velvet""; the pair leave early so that Jeffrey can investigate her apartment in her absence. However, Dorothy returns home early, discovers Jeffrey hiding in a closet, and threatens him with a knife. Believing Jeffrey's curiosity to be sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy forces him to undress and fellates him. Jeffrey retreats back to the closet when their encounter is interrupted by the arrival of a man named Frank Booth, who beats and subjects Dorothy to a variety of violent sex acts during the course of a roleplaying game in which he refers to her as ""mommy"" and himself as ""baby"" or ""daddy"". It becomes apparent that Frank—a gangster—has abducted Dorothy's husband and child to force her into sex slavery. After Frank departs, Dorothy makes a romantic overture toward Jeffrey, who leaves. A disturbed Jeffrey relays the experience to Sandy, who tells him about a prophetic dream in which robins descend from the sky to eat and kill insects that have overrun the world. Jeffrey returns to Dorothy's apartment, where she confesses an attraction to him and the two enter into a sadomasochistic sexual relationship in which Dorothy encourages Jeffrey to beat her, though he proves hesitant. Later, Jeffrey observes Frank in the audience at one of Dorothy's shows and begins following him, observing him engaging in drug dealing and a meeting with the Yellow Man. Jeffrey tells Sandy about his observations and the two briefly kiss; later, Jeffrey returns to Dorothy, who coerces him into a violent sexual encounter that leaves him disturbed. Frank catches Jeffrey and Dorothy together and abducts them, forcing Jeffrey to accompany him to the home of a criminal associate named Ben, who is holding Dorothy's family hostage.

Later, Jeffrey confesses everything to Sandy and the two attend a party together where they admit their feelings for one another. On the way home, they're pursued by an unidentified car and assume it's Frank and his gang. As they arrive at Jeffrey's home, Sandy recognizes the car as that of her boyfriend, Mike. Mike and his gang leap from his car, ready to beat up Jeffrey for stealing Sandy. Before the fight can start, a naked and beaten Dorothy emerges. Though confused, Mike realizes that there's nothing between Jeffrey and Sandy, and he retreats as the two whisk Dorothy to Sandy's house. Jeffrey asks Sandy to tell her father everything and returns alone to Dorothy's apartment, where he discovers her husband dead and The Yellow Man mortally wounded. Remembering that Frank has a police radio in his car, Jeffrey uses the Yellow Man's walkie-talkie to lie about his precise location in the apartment; after Frank enters, Jeffrey ambushes and shoots him dead with the Yellow Man's gun. Sandy's father leads a police raid on Frank's headquarters, killing his men and crippling his criminal empire. Jeffrey and Sandy enter into a relationship and attend a family barbecue with his recuperated father, where they note the presence of a robin consuming a bug, while Dorothy is reunited with her son."
Amsterdam,"In 1918, Burt Berendsen was sent by his estranged wife's parents to fight in World War I. While stationed in France, Burt befriends African-American soldier Harold Woodman. After sustaining injuries in battle, Burt and Harold are nursed back to health by Valerie Bandenberg, an eccentric nurse who makes art out of shrapnel removed from the soldiers, whom they befriend as well. After the end of the war, the three live together in Amsterdam and become close friends until Burt returns to New York City to be with his wife. Harold has fallen in love with Valerie and begun a tenuous romantic relationship with her. But Valerie abandons Harold, so he returns to New York. Fifteen years later, Burt has opened his medical practice catering to veterans of the war, and remains friends with Harold, who is now a lawyer. However, they have not heard from Valerie since they left Amsterdam. Harold asks Burt to perform an autopsy on Bill Meekins (a senator who served as the commander of their regiment during the war) at the behest of Meekins' daughter Elizabeth, who believes that he was murdered during his recent trip to Europe. Burt performs the autopsy with the help of medical examiner Irma St. Clair. The autopsy reveals a considerable amount of poison in Meekins' stomach; Burt and Irma theorize that this must have been his cause of death. Burt and Harold meet with Elizabeth to talk about the autopsy results, though she is suddenly killed when a hitman pushes her into traffic. The hitman frames Burt and Harold for her death, and they flee as the police arrive. Burt and Harold attempt to find out who told Elizabeth to hire them in order to clear their names. This leads them to wealthy textile heir, Tom Voze, his patronizing wife Libby, and Tom’s sister, Valerie (whose real surname is Voze). They learn that Valerie was the one who convinced Elizabeth to hire them, knowing that they were trustworthy. Valerie is under constant supervision by Tom and Libby, who claim that she suffers from a nerve disease and epilepsy. It is later revealed that they were poisoning Valerie to keep her compliant. Burt and Harold talk with Tom, who suggests they talk to General Gil Dillenbeck, a famous and decorated veteran who is friends with Meekins, to learn who accompanied Meekins on the trip (and might have poisoned him or be able to lead them to the person who did). While Burt attempts to contact the General, Irma visits him at his medical practice and reveals that she was attacked and her wrist broken while trying to bring him the autopsy report and the attacker took the paper from her. After resetting her wrist, Burt and Irma share a kiss. Meanwhile, Harold and Valerie spend the day at her home, where they notice the hitman, Tarim Milfax, has been watching the house. They follow him to a forced sterilization clinic owned by a mysterious organization known as the ""Committee of the Five"". After a fight with Milfax, Harold and Valerie reunite with Burt. Valerie takes them to the Waldorf Astoria New York, where they meet Paul Canterbury and Henry Norcross, Valerie's benefactors from Amsterdam who are secretly spies in the intelligence community. Paul and Henry explain that the Committee of the Five is a cabal in the US with ties to Germany planning to overthrow the American government and that Dillenbeck can help foil their plot. The trio meets with General Dillenbeck, who is offered a large sum of money from a man on behalf of an unnamed benefactor to deliver a speech advocating for veterans to forcibly remove U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install Dillenbeck as a puppet dictator instead. The General agrees to help the trio foil the plot and agrees to speak at a veterans reunion gala Burt and Harold are hosting in order to draw out whoever is behind the plot. At the gala, General Dillenbeck reads his speech instead of the one he was paid to read. Milfax tries to shoot him for doing so, but Harold and Valerie and then Burt manage to stop him in time. Milfax is arrested and the Committee of the Five is revealed to be four industry leaders, including Tom, who is fanatically obsessed with Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and intend to turn the United States into a fascist country. Tom and the other leaders are arrested by the police, but they do not stay in jail long, and slander General Dillenbeck in the press following their release. General Dillenbeck testifies about the incident to Congress and returns home to live out his life. Harold and Valerie leave the country since they cannot be together in the United States. Burt wishes them farewell, planning to reopen his medical practice and pursue a relationship with Irma."
Silver Bullet,"Jane Coslaw serves as the narrator of the film as well as the older sister of the main protagonist of the movie, her paraplegic brother Marty.

Railroad worker Arnie is decapitated by a unseen attacker, pregnant Stella prepares to kill herself but is brutally murdered in her own bedroom, an abusive father is killed in his greenhouse, and Marty's best friend, Brady, is also killed. After Brady's death, citizens form a vigilante justice group.  Although local Sheriff Joe Haller attempts to stop the citizens, he relents after being berated by Brady's father. Reverend Lowe fails to dissuade the townsfolk from causing further bloodshed. While the vigilantes hunt for the killer in the nearby woods, three are attacked and killed. The survivors later deny seeing anything unusual. Afterwards, Reverend Lowe dreams that he is presiding over a mass funeral when his congregation – including the bodies in the caskets – begins to transform into werewolves before his eyes and attack him. He awakens screaming and asks God to ""let it end."" As a result of the mounting unsolved murders, curfews are put in place, canceling the town’s Fourth of July celebration. The Coslaws decide to have their own backyard party and invite Nan's alcoholic brother, Red. Red gives the gift of a custom-built wheelchair/motorcycle to Marty, which he nicknames the ""Silver Bullet,"" as well as a pile of fireworks so he can have his own celebration. Marty uses the Silver Bullet to go out in the middle of the night to a bridge where he lights the fireworks. The fireworks get the Werewolf's attention, and it confronts him, but he escapes after launching a rocket into the creature's eye. Marty enlists Jane's help to look for someone with a newly injured or missing eye. She discovers that Reverend Lowe is missing his left eye. Realizing that no adult would believe his story, Marty begins sending anonymous notes to Reverend Lowe telling him that he knows who he is, what he is, and that he should commit suicide in order to stop the killings. Lowe tries to run Marty off the road with his car. When Marty is trapped under a closed covered bridge, Lowe, whose sanity has been fractured by his condition, tries to rationalize the murders he has committed as doing God's work. Lowe apologizes and moves in for the kill until Marty calls for help from a passerby. The siblings manage to convince Red that Lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill Marty. Red persuades Sheriff Haller to investigate. That night, Haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, goes to Lowe's house and finds Lowe has locked himself in his garage to restrain himself from further killings. Before Haller can arrest him, Lowe transforms and bludgeons Haller to death. Knowing the werewolf is coming for them next, Marty and Jane convince Red to take Jane's silver cross and Marty's silver medallion to the gunsmith, who melts them down into a silver bullet. On the night of the full moon, they wait for the werewolf, who cuts the power to the house and smashes its way inside, attacking Red. The bullet is nearly lost in the melee, but Marty is able to retrieve it and shoots the werewolf in the right eye. The corpse turns back into Lowe before dying. As the trio recover, Marty and Jane say they love each other and embrace, and Jane narrates that although she hadn't always been able to say it, she was able to say it from then on."

While Wendy is trying to decide between Sean and her friends, Wendy's younger brother Nathan meets Sean's mother, Helen, who is waiting a long three weeks to start a new job. Nathan develops a huge crush on her, and he uses his considerable cooking skills to try and woo her. Then Wendy spends another Saturday night with the group, and she is unable to ""cheat"" on Sean; her hesitation is all that Billie needs to accuse her best friend. After the girls fight, Wendy takes out her frustration on a random couple who keep making out in front of her house. Ryan, hearing that Wendy is out of the group, tries to be friends, but Wendy is conflicted. Sean and Wendy try to be a ""normal"" couple, but the group quickly tests the relationship: Billie puts the box of memorabilia in Sean's locker. Wendy claims she is not scared; she knows that Sean loves her. Maybe so, but when he sees the photos that document a lifetime of sexual experimentation, he is fed up and offers an ultimatum: Wendy can burn the box, leave the group, and be a normal girl, or they can break up. Wendy has gone from one ultimatum to another. When Wendy sees Billie being hassled for being alone by other students, she wants to comfort her friend. Billie invites Wendy back to the group but she tests her—pushing Wendy to publicly ridicule Ryan, a girl who left the group last year along with her boyfriend, Aaron. Billie believes that seeing a really dark side of Wendy will keep Sean away for good, and somehow restore their group. Wendy takes it a step further though, outing everyone's secrets; not just in front of Sean but in front of the student body. Each of the six has some skeletons in their closet, and having them all exposed is going to leave everyone isolated from their pseudofamily of six, and also ostracised within the school. The future (which Billie was planning out 10 years at the beginning of the movie) is a lot less certain - and Wendy is going to be the first one out of the gate in finding something new."
Notting Hill,"William Thacker owns an independent book store in Notting Hill, London. He meets Hollywood actress Anna Scott when she enters the shop incognito. Later, in the street, Will accidentally spills his drink on her, and she goes to his house to change and, upon leaving, impulsively kisses him. She later invites Will to visit her at the Ritz Hotel, but he is mistaken for a reporter and ushered into a press junket for Anna's new film and must pretend to interview her. Anna asks to be his date to his sister's birthday party that evening, where she gets on well with Will's friends and sister and seems to envy their ordinary lives. The next night Will takes her out; at a restaurant they overhear a group of men disparaging Anna because of her screen image. Will remonstrates with them, and is impressed with how calmly she puts them down. Anna invites him to her hotel room, but their plans change when Will discovers that her movie star boyfriend, of whom he was unaware, has unexpectedly arrived from America to be with her. Will is obliged to pretend to be a hotel worker in order to avoid detection. Will's friends try to help him get over his disappointment. Over the next six months, they set him up on a series of dates, including one with a fruitarian, but he finds it impossible to forget Anna. One day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep, in need of a place to hide from a tabloid scandal. She apologizes for the hotel incident, telling Will that her relationship with her boyfriend is in the past. They enjoy spending time together and discovering their shared interests, including Will's print of Marc Chagall's 1950 painting La Mariée. They sleep together that night, but their bliss is short-lived when the paparazzi, tipped off by Will's housemate Spike, besiege Will's house and get pictures of him, Anna, and Spike half-dressed at the front door. Furious, Anna blames Will for the situation, declares that she regrets their time together, and leaves. Seasons pass and Will remains miserable. At a dinner with his friends, he discovers that Anna, by this time an Oscar winner, is back in London making a film. He visits her location shoot, where Anna sees him and invites him past security, so that he can watch the filming with the intention of them talking privately afterwards. Despite realising that the film is a period Henry James rendition (something he had suggested), Will overhears her dismiss him to a co-star, and leaves without further contact. The next day, Anna comes to the bookshop with a wrapped gift, and apologises, explaining that she did not want to truthfully discuss her private life with an indiscreet co-star. She admits to Will that she loves him and asks if they can repair their relationship, but he rejects her out of fear of being hurt again. Will meets his friends and sister in a restaurant with the opened gift: Chagall's original La Mariée (""The Bride""). They act supportively, half-heartedly backing up his decision. Spike, however, declares Will a ""daft prick"", and Will admits his mistake. They race across London to Anna's hotel, where they learn that she has checked out and is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. Will arrives to hear Anna's publicist tell the crowd that Anna will be taking a year off and will be leaving the UK that night. Will, again pretending to be a reporter, admits he made the wrong decision and begs Anna to reconsider. After exchanging a few subtle glances with Will, Anna announces that she will be staying in Britain ""indefinitely,"" and the press is abuzz, realising that Will is actually Anna's love interest. The final scenes show Anna and Will marrying, attending a Hollywood red carpet event, and spending quiet time in a park they had visited on their first date. Anna is now pregnant."

The African Queen,"Samuel Sayer and his sister Rose are British Methodist missionaries in the village of Kungdu in German East Africa at the beginning of World War I in September 1914. Their mail and supplies are delivered by a small steam launch named the African Queen, helmed by the rough-and-ready Canadian mechanic Charlie Allnut, whose coarse behavior they stiffly tolerate. When Charlie warns the Sayers that war has broken out between Germany and Britain, they choose to remain in Kungdu, only to witness German colonial troops burn down the village and herd the villagers away to be forcibly recruited. When Samuel protests, he is beaten by an officer, and becomes delirious with fever and soon dies. Charlie returns shortly afterward after having found his mine to have been destroyed by the Germans and being chased for his supplies, which include gelatin explosives. He helps Rose bury her brother, and they set off in the African Queen. While planning their escape, Charlie mentions to Rose that the British are unable to attack the Germans due to the presence of a large gunboat, the Königin Luise, patrolling a large lake downriver. Rose comes up with a plan to convert the African Queen into a torpedo boat and sink the Königin Luise. Charlie points out that navigating the Ulanga River to get to the lake would be suicidal: they would have to pass a German fort and negotiate several dangerous rapids. But Rose is insistent and eventually persuades him to go along with the plan. Eventually Charlie becomes inebriated and drunkenly insults Rose and her plan, who retaliates by dumping his supply of gin into the river. Charlie allows Rose to navigate the river by rudder while he tends the engine, and she is emboldened after they get through the first set of rapids with minimal flooding in the boat. But when they pass the fortress and the soldiers begin shooting at them, the bullets damage the boiler, although they are unable to shoot the boat severely due to the sun getting in their eyes. Charlie manages to reattach a pressure hose just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding in the boat. However, they make it through. While celebrating their success, the two find themselves in an embrace. Embarrassed, they break off, but eventually succumb and become lovers. The third set of rapids damages the propeller shaft. Rigging up a primitive forge on shore, Charlie straightens the shaft, welds a new blade onto the prop, and they are off again. All appears lost when the boat becomes mired in the mud and dense reeds near the mouth of the river. They try to tow the boat through the muck, only to have Charlie come out of the water covered with leeches. With no supplies left and short of potable water, Rose and a feverish Charlie pass out, both accepting they will die soon. Rose says a quiet prayer. As they sleep, exhausted and beaten, torrential  rains far upstream gently raise the river's level and float the African Queen off of the mud and into the lake. Once on the lake, they narrowly avoid being spotted by the Königin Luise. Over the next two days, Charlie and Rose convert some oxygen cylinders into torpedoes using gelatin explosives and improvised detonators. They push the torpedoes through holes cut in the bow of the African Queen as improvised spar torpedoes. The Königin Luise returns, and Charlie and Rose steam the African Queen out onto the lake in darkness, intending to set her on a collision course. A strong storm strikes which causes water to pour into the African Queen through the torpedo holes. Eventually the African Queen capsizes, throwing them both into the water. Charlie loses sight of Rose in the storm. Charlie is captured and taken aboard the Königin Luise, where he is interrogated by the captain.  Believing that Rose has drowned, he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of spying, and the German captain sentences him to death by hanging. However, Rose is captured and brought to the Königin Luise just after Charlie's sentence is pronounced. The captain questions her, and Rose confesses the whole plot proudly, deciding they have nothing to lose. The captain sentences her to be executed with Charlie, both as a British spies. Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before executing them. After a brief marriage ceremony, there is an explosion and the Königin Luise quickly capsizes. The Königin Luise has struck the overturned submerged hull of the African Queen and detonated the torpedoes. The newly married couple happily swims to safety."
Overboard,"Heiress Joanna Stayton is accustomed to a wealthy life with her own yacht and fortune, along with her husband Grant Stayton III. While waiting for her yacht to be repaired in the fictional seaside town of Elk Cove, Oregon, Joanna hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt, a widower with four sons, to remodel her closet. Dean produces quality work, which she dismisses because he used oak instead of cedar, despite her not having requested this at the start. Dean agrees to redo the closet if he is paid for the work he has already done, to no avail. The two have an argument, during which he berates her for her entitled attitude. This results in an angry Joanna throwing Dean and his tool kit into the water. That night, as the yacht sails away, Joanna goes on deck to retrieve a wedding ring, but loses her balance and falls overboard. She is later fished out of the water by a garbage scow. Now suffering from amnesia, Joanna is taken to the local hospital. Grant learns of this and heads to pick Joanna up, but after seeing her mental state, he decides otherwise. Intending to have her fortune to himself, he returns to the yacht and has parties with younger women, lying that Joanna has decided to leave him. After seeing her story on the news, Dean seeks revenge by encouraging Joanna to work off her unpaid bill. He goes to the hospital and tells her that she is his wife Annie and the mother of his four unruly sons. She reluctantly goes home with him and is appalled by the family’s ramshackle residence. Joanna initially has difficulty dealing with Dean's sons and the heavy load of chores, but she soon adapts. As she masters her responsibilities, she learns about the boys' school and family issues, and that Dean is secretly working two jobs to make ends meet. She falls in love with him and starts to care about his sons. She streamlines the money problems with more efficient budgeting and convinces Dean to be a more responsible father. Joanna makes Dean's dream come true by helping him design a miniature golf course. He also falls in love with her, but does not tell her about her real identity, fearing that she will leave. Four months later, Joanna's mother Edith learns what happened and threatens to have Grant hunted down. He is reluctantly forced to end the partying and return to Elk Cove to retrieve Joanna, whose memory is restored upon seeing him. Realizing that she was manipulated, a distraught Joanna returns with Grant to their yacht, which heads for New York. Joanna finds her old lifestyle boring and is uncomfortable with how rudely Grant and Edith treat the boat staff. She apologizes to her butler Andrew and the crew for her spiteful treatment towards them, and soon realizes how happy she was with Dean and his sons, prompting her to turn the yacht back towards Elk Cove. The next morning, Grant finds out that Joanna has changed course and becomes insane. While taking charge of the boat, he admits to purposely abandoning Joanna and having numerous affairs with other women in her absence. Dean and the boys arrive on a Coast Guard boat to rescue Joanna, but are called away due to a sighting of salmon poachers. She is stunned the boat is turning around, thinking Dean changed his mind. He runs to the back of the boat and calls out to Joanna. He then jumps into the water to swim to her, and she does the same. An insane Grant furiously takes aim at Joanna with a bow and arrow, only to be booted overboard by Andrew. Dean initially believes Joanna gave up her rich life for him, but she tells him the money and the boat are hers. The two are then brought on board the Coast Guard boat, and they stand above his four sons who are making out their Christmas lists. Dean asks Joanna what he could possibly give her that she doesn't already have. She answers, ""A little girl"", and they kiss while the boat sails off into the sunset."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"Ten years after the deadly Simian Flu pandemic, the worldwide human population is drastically reduced, with only about 1 in 500 genetically immune. Human civilization has been destroyed after societal collapse among humans. A colony of apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco, led by Caesar, along with his lieutenants Maurice, Rocket, and Koba. A group of humans, led by Malcolm, unknowingly enter the apes' territory in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to their community in San Francisco. Carver, a member of Malcolm's group, injures Ash, Rocket's son, in an unexpected confrontation. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings his army to the human community as a display of strength. Caesar announces that, while the apes do not want war, they will fight to defend themselves; he demands the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus, the community's leader, to give him a chance to take a small team to the forest with the mission of reconciling with the apes and accessing the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile truce briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but trust is restored when Ellie, who is a nurse, saves Cornelia, Caesar's ill wife. Paranoid that the apes may attack, Dreyfus arms the community with the munitions at the Fort Point armory. Koba, who hates humans for torturing him as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of caring more about humans than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory, kills two guards, returns home, and secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the ape colony. Unseen by the others, he shoots and seemingly kills Caesar, who falls into the underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. Koba kills Ash for refusing to kill unarmed humans and imprisons all other apes loyal to Caesar, including Rocket, Maurice, and Luca. Malcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former home in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's son. Blue Eyes leaves him alone before learning that his father is still alive and accompanies Malcolm to Caesar. Learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reunites with his father. The trio returns to the community and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus, who reveals that his men made radio contact with a military base. Malcolm holds Dreyfus and his men at gunpoint to give Caesar enough time to retake command, and Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower. In an attempt to kill all the apes, Dreyfus detonates explosives to destabilize the building, killing himself in the process. Caesar defeats Koba and refuses to help him as he falls to his death. Malcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar orders Malcolm to evacuate with his family for safety before the fighting begins. He then addresses the apes as they prepare for the upcoming war."
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"In 2286, an enormous cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of every ship it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns all space-faring vessels not to approach Earth. On the planet Vulcan, the former officers of the late USS Enterprise are living in exile. Accompanied by the Vulcan Spock, still recovering from his resurrection, the crew take their captured Klingon Bird of Prey and return to Earth to face trial for their actions. Receiving Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the song of extinct humpback whales and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to travel back in time via a slingshot maneuver around the Sun, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal. Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained by the time travel maneuver. Hiding the Bounty in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its cloaking device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage can be collected and used to re-power the Klingon vessel. Kirk and Spock discover a pair of humpback whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a Sausalito aquarium and learn they will soon be released into the wild. Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Scott and McCoy trade the formula of transparent aluminium for the materials needed for the whale tank, while Sulu secures the use of a ""Huey"" helicopter to transport them. Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear-powered ship, the aircraft carrier Enterprise. They collect the power they need but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed out, but Chekov is captured, interrogated (under the assumption he is a Soviet spy), and subsequently severely injured in an escape attempt. Gillian learns the whales have been released early and goes to Kirk for assistance. Gillian, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov from a nearby hospital and return to the now-recharged Bird of Prey. After saving the whales from whalers and transporting them aboard, the crew returns with Gillian to their own time. On approaching Earth, the Bounty loses power due to the alien probe and crash-lands into the waters of San Francisco Bay. Once released from near-drowning, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space. Later, the Enterprise crew stand judgment before the Federation Council. The Council acknowledges their part in saving the planet and drops all charges, save one against Kirk for disobeying a superior officer. Kirk is demoted to the rank of captain and returned to the command of a starship. Kirk and Gillian part ways, as she has been assigned to a science vessel by Starfleet, while Spock's father Sarek finally accepts his son's earlier choice to enter Starfleet. The crew discovers they have been awarded the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a shakedown mission."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"The Federation starship Enterprise limps back to Earth following a battle with the superman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into orbit around the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is arrested. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device. David Marcus—Kirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis' development—and the Vulcan Saavik are investigating the Genesis planet from the science vessel Grissom. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus, pressed by Saavik, admits that he used unstable ""protomatter"" in the construction of the Genesis Device, meaning that Spock is rapidly aging and the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, commander Kruge, a member of the alien Klingon race, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be a potent weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys  Grissom, and captures Marcus, Saavik, and Spock. Spock's father, Sarek, meets with Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body are needed to lay him to rest on the Vulcan homeworld, and without help McCoy will die from carrying the katra. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the USS Excelsior, and steal Enterprise from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet. In orbit, Enterprise is attacked and disabled by Kruge. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders that one of the hostages on the surface be executed; David is killed defending Saavik. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate Enterprise's self-destruct sequence, killing the Klingon boarding party while the Enterprise crew beams down to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him beam his crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in hand-to-hand combat; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking the Klingon off a cliff. Overwhelming the last member of the Klingon crew, Kirk and his officers set course for Vulcan. Spock's katra is reunited with his body in a dangerous procedure called fal tor pan. The ceremony is successful and Spock is resurrected alive and well, though his memories are  fragmented. At Kirk's prompting, Spock remembers he called Kirk ""Jim"" and recognizes the crew."
Star Trek: First Contact,"In the 24th century, Captain Jean Luc Picard awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier. He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship, USS Enterprise, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight. Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. Enterprise arrives in time to assist the crew of USS Defiant and its captain, the Klingon Worf. After Admiral Hayes is killed, Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship. The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet. Enterprise pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears, Enterprise discovers Earth has been altered – it is now populated entirely by Borg. Realizing the Borg have used time travel to change the past, Enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex.Enterprise arrives hundreds of years in its past on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's historic warp drive flight; the crew realizes the Borg are trying to prevent first contact. After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, Phoenix, in Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to Enterprise for medical attention. The captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander William T. Riker on Earth to make sure Phoenix's flight proceeds as planned. While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, the real man is reluctant to assume the role the Enterprise crew describe.A group of Borg invade Enterprise's lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are forced back; the android Data is captured in the melee. A frightened Sloane corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the holodeck. Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Hawk, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling reinforcements by using the deflector dish. As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward. Sloane confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally. Picard orders an activation of the ship's self-destruct, then orders the crew to head for the escape pods while he stays behind to rescue Data.As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has long desired so that she can obtain the android's encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom, Data refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at Phoenix. At the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her. The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive vapor eats away the biological components of the Borg. With the Borg threat neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp flight. The next day the crew watches from a distance as an alien Vulcan ship, attracted by the Phoenix warp test, lands on Earth. Cochrane and Sloane greet the aliens. Having ensured the correction of the timeline, the Enterprise crew slip away and return to the 24th century."
2001: A Space Odyssey,"In a prehistoric veld, a tribe of hominins is driven away from its water hole by a rival tribe. The next day, they find an alien monolith has appeared in their midst. The tribe then learn how to use a bone as a weapon and, after their first hunt, return to drive their rivals away with it. Millions of years later, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station 5, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Heywood addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As he and others examine the object and are taking photographs, it emits a high-powered radio signal. Eighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Dave retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Dave and Frank enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading. While Frank is floating away from his pod to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of the pod and attacks him, sending Frank tumbling away from the ship with a severed air line. Dave takes another pod to rescue Frank. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Dave returns to the ship with Frank's body, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Dave releases Frank's body and opens the ship's emergency airlock with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he jettisons the pod's door, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discovery's airlock. He enters HAL's processor core and begins disconnecting most of HAL's circuits, ignoring HAL's pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood plays, revealing that the mission's actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter. At Jupiter, Dave finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Dave reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light floating in space above the Earth."
Finch,"Fifteen years have passed since a massive solar flare destroyed the ozone layer, turning the planet Earth into a largely uninhabitable wasteland ravaged by extreme weather events while being scorched by the sun's ultraviolet rays, increasing surface temperatures to 150 °F (66 °C; 339 K). One of the few survivors, robotics engineer Finch Weinberg, lives alone with his dog Goodyear and a helper-robot Dewey in an underground St. Louis laboratory once owned by the company he worked for before the cataclysm. Finch only ventures outside, wearing a protective suit, to search for supplies. Dying of an undisclosed ailment (although Finch is seen reading a book on radiation poisoning), Finch is working on creating a more advanced humanoid robot companion to take care of his dog once he is gone. Finch feeds it volumes of encyclopedic knowledge, including a manual for training and caring for dogs. However, Goodyear initially doesn't trust the robot (which eventually chooses the name Jeff). Finch discovers that a massive storm is approaching St. Louis that will certainly destroy the area and kill him. Finch, Jeff, Dewey, and Goodyear set out in a heavily modified motorhome towards San Francisco. Because of the hasty departure, Jeff could download only 72% of his encyclopedic data, and his mental capacity requires training. Despite his condition worsening, Finch tries to teach Jeff some valuable lessons about life and how to protect Goodyear. Jeff's inquisitive behavior both amuses and frustrates Finch, but the robot slowly shows more initiative. By the time they reach Denver, Finch becomes bedridden and Jeff decides to loot an abandoned hospital with Dewey. Dewey unwittingly gets crushed by a beartrap and Finch retrieves Jeff to escape the city, realizing that the area is a trap set up by other humans. Later in the evening, the motorhome is pursued by an unknown car (which evidently followed them from the hospital). Finch makes a panicked error in judgment and crashes their vehicle through an underpass with too little clearance, but Jeff is strong enough to squeeze it out of sight. Finch begins to give up hope that he will survive the journey and tells a story (in a flashback) about how he rescued Goodyear. Approaching their destination, the UV radiation has dropped low enough for Finch to be able to step out into the sunshine without a protective suit. Ecstatic, Finch spends an afternoon outside with Jeff, teaching him how to play fetch with Goodyear before quietly dying. After cremating Finch in a funeral pyre, Jeff and Goodyear make their way to San Francisco. Although they find the city habitable but deserted, they find possible evidence of surviving humans at the Golden Gate Bridge and set out to find them."
Black Rain,"Nick Conklin is a New York City police officer facing possible criminal charges; Internal Affairs believes Nick was involved with his partner, who was caught taking criminal money in a corruption scandal. Nick, who has financial difficulties, is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children. At a restaurant, Nick and his partner Charlie Vincent observe two Japanese men meeting with Mafia gangsters. Nick's suspicions are validated when another Japanese man enters the restaurant, seizes a small package at gunpoint, kills two people, and leaves. Nick and Charlie chase and arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick. Sato is to be extradited to Osaka and given to the police there. Though angered that Sato will not be prosecuted in the US, Nick agrees to escort him. Nick's captain believes it will keep Nick from causing more trouble and exacerbating the already biased Internal Affairs investigation. When they arrive in Osaka, they surrender Sato to the Japanese police, only to discover that they were duped by impostors. Nick convinces the Osaka police to allow them to observe the investigation, though their weapons are confiscated. They are assigned to Masahiro Matsumoto. Nick behaves rudely and offends Matsumoto, while Charlie attempts to be more polite. Nick also makes contact with an American nightclub hostess, Joyce, who explains that Nick and Charlie represent American inefficiency and stupidity to the Japanese. Through her, Nick discovers Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious crime boss, Sugai, and traveled to New York to disrupt Sugai's counterfeiting scheme. Nick joins a police raid without permission and takes a few $100 bills from the crime scene. The next day, Matsumoto explains they have dishonored themselves, him, and the police force by his theft, which has been reported in America; Nick calls him a snitch and demonstrates the money is counterfeit by burning one of the bills. At night, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel drunk and unescorted, despite warnings about their safety. In an apparent prank, a young motorcyclist steals Charlie's coat and leads him to an underground parking garage. Separated from Charlie, Nick watches in horror as Sato and several others briefly torture and kill Charlie. Joyce comforts the distraught Nick at her apartment. Later, Matsumoto hands him Charlie's service pistol. As Matsumoto and Nick trail one of Sato's operatives, Nick admits he stole money in New York. The operative retrieves a sample counterfeit note, which she passes to a gangster. Nick and Matsumoto tail him to a steel foundry, where they find Sato is meeting Sugai, and the package from New York is a printing plate for American $100 bills. Nick confronts Sato, who escapes when swarming police arrest Nick for waving a gun in public. Though deported, Nick sneaks off the plane to pursue Sato on his own, as Matsumoto has been suspended and demoted. Joyce helps him meet Sugai, who explains that making counterfeit US currency is his revenge for the ""black rain"", or nuclear fallout, after the bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. Nick suggests a deal where Sugai can use Nick to retrieve the stolen plate from Sato, leaving Sugai's reputation and hands clean. Sugai drops Nick at a remote farm with a shotgun. Matsumoto arrives, and they deduce Sato plans a massacre. During a meeting with Sugai, Sato cuts off one of his fingers in atonement, stabs Sugai, and escapes with the plates, prompting a gunfight between Sugai's and Sato's men. Sato escapes the fight on a dirt bike, Nick pursues, and the two fight briefly. Nick gains the advantage and, having Sato at his mercy, has the choice of whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and all the humiliation he has suffered. Matsumoto and Nick walk a handcuffed Sato into police headquarters to the amazement of everyone and later receive commendations, which Nick accepts gratefully. Before boarding his flight home, Nick thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and friendship, and gives him a dress shirt in a gift box. Underneath it, Matsumoto finds the counterfeit printing plates."
Death Note,"In Seattle, Washington, high school senior Light Turner stumbles across the Death Note, a mysterious leather-bound notebook with instructions that state that by writing a person's name down within it, that person will die in the manner prescribed. Light meets Ryuk, a death god and the notebook's owner. Ryuk convinces Light to use the notebook; Light writes down a bully's name and shortly thereafter witnesses him being killed in a freak accident. That night, Light tries it again, using the name of his mother's killer, Anthony Skomal, and learns the next morning from his father James, a police detective, that Skomal died as Light had written. At school, Light shows Mia the book and demonstrates its power by killing a known criminal felon during a televised hostage situation. The two decide to work together to rid the world of criminals and terrorists, with Light deciding on using the name Kira (derived from the Japanese trans-literation for ""Killer"", so as to direct investigative attention away from their continent). Kira's actions draw the attention of enigmatic international detective L, who deduces Kira is a Seattle-based student with close ties to the police and indirectly concludes Kira can only kill by knowing the name and face of their victim. Working with James and the police, L has several FBI agents track Light and other suspects. Light refuses to kill them when Mia suggests it, but soon the agents commit mass suicide, which Light believes Ryuk made them do. James threatens Kira over public broadcast but when he fails to be killed, L confronts Light about being Kira and prepares the police to thoroughly search Light's home. Light decides to use the Death Note to force L's personal assistant Watari to travel to Montauk, New York, and find L's adoption record there; Light plans to burn the notebook page with Watari's name once he knows L's name to stop Watari's death, then kill L. Mia helps to sneak the notebook out before the search. Light and Mia go to the school dance, using the event to ditch L and the police. Light recovers the notebook just as Watari contacts him with L's name from the orphanage he was raised in, but Light cannot find the page in the notebook where Watari's name is written. Watari is then killed by security for trespassing before he can reveal L's name. Light discovers Mia took Watari's page, caused the agents' suicide, and has written Light's name in the book, set to kill him at midnight, but she offers to burn his page if he turns the notebook over to her. Light flees, telling Mia to meet him at the Seattle Great Wheel. Enraged at Watari's death, L leaves on a personal manhunt against Light, while James orders L to be detained. L corners Light, but a Kira Supporter, hearing that Light is Kira, knocks L out, letting Light escape. Mia meets Light at the wheel and they ride to the top. There, Mia steals the notebook, but realizes too late this was Light's plan: Light has written her death in the notebook contingent on her taking it. Ryuk then makes the wheel collapse, sending Mia falling to her death, while Light and the notebook fall into the nearby waters. L witnesses the page with Light's name land in a burning barrel. Before meeting Mia, Light had used the book to coerce a criminally-charged doctor to rescue him and put him into a medically-induced coma, while having another criminal recover the Death Note and continue Kira's killings before returning the book to his bedside, killing both after their role is complete. Meanwhile, L is ordered off the case for his apparent misconduct, but in defiance, he raids Mia's home, finds the notebook page with the agents' names and deduces its capabilities. In a hysterical fit, he considers writing a name (implied to be Light's). When Light wakes from his coma at a hospital with James, who has come to conclude Light is Kira, by his side, he tries to convince James that his actions were ""the lesser of two evils"", prompting Ryuk to laugh and comment that “humans are so interesting.”"
Sense and Sensibility,"On his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood tells his son from his first marriage, John, to take care of his second wife and three daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, since they will inherit nothing. John promises to do so. John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny convinces him to give his half sisters nothing financially; John and Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Sir John Middleton, Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in and are frequent guests at Barton Park. The Dashwoods meet the older Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with Marianne at first sight. However, Marianne considers him incapable of feeling love or inspiring it in another. One afternoon, Marianne takes a walk with Margaret and slips and falls in the rain. She is carried home by the dashing John Willoughby, with whom Marianne falls in love. They spend a great deal of time together, but on the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London. Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, to visit. They bring with them Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He greets Marianne uncomfortably and barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they soon learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable. Colonel Brandon later explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and abandoned his ward Beth, the illegitimate daughter of his former love. When Willoughby's aunt and benefactress Lady Allen learned of his behavior, she disinherited him and so he chose to marry for money. Lucy is invited to stay with John and Fanny. Lucy, believing she has a friend in Fanny, confides her clandestine engagement to Edward and is thrown out of the house. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement.

Marianne becomes gravely ill after walking in torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy. The Dashwoods soon learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume she married Edward. Later when Edward visits their house, they learn that Miss Steele married his brother Robert. Edward proposes to and marries Elinor. Marianne marries Colonel Brandon. Willoughby is seen watching their wedding from a distance and then rides away."
Three Men and a Baby,"Architect Peter Mitchell (Tom Selleck), cartoonist Michael Kellam (Steve Guttenberg) and actor Jack Holden (Ted Danson) are happy living their lives as bachelors in their lofty New York City apartment. Their lives are disrupted when a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep one day. A note with the child, Mary, indicates that it is Jack's, the result of an affair with a recent co-star. The baby arrives in Jack's absence – he is in Turkey shooting a B movie, leaving Peter and Michael to fend for themselves in taking care of the child. Prior to leaving, Jack had made arrangements with a director friend to have a ""package"" delivered to the apartment as a favor. Before Mary's arrival, Jack calls and leaves a message with Peter and Michael informing them of the ""package"" and to keep it a secret per the director friend's wishes. When Mary arrives, Peter and Michael mistakenly believe she is the ""package"", even though there is a note from her mother. Peter and Michael are totally befuddled on how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to go buy whatever supplies are needed. While Peter is gone, Mrs. Hathaway (Cynthia Harris), the landlady, delivers a small box (which is the actual ""package"" containing heroin) to the apartment and Michael tosses it aside while trying to keep Mary under control. After Peter returns, the two eventually figure out Mary's proper care, right down to diaper changes, bathings, and feedings. The next day, two men (who are drug dealers) arrive at the apartment to collect the heroin. Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to the men instead, and shortly after they leave, Peter discovers the actual package. He runs downstairs to intercept the dealers, but trips and stumbles, and the box's contents spill. Peter gathers the heroin and retrieves Mary from the drug dealers, but retains the heroin while allowing the dealers to take a can of powdered milk. After the exchange, a police officer attempts to ticket the drug dealers for illegal parking, but they escape. The officer accosts Peter and detains him in the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz (Philip Bosco), a narcotics officer, arrives to question Peter and Michael about the drugs. They successfully hide the drugs from Melkowitz during the interrogation, in which they learn that Jack's friend is a drug dealer as well. Melkowitz leaves with suspicions and puts the men and the apartment under surveillance. Peter and Michael are able to persuade Mrs. Hathaway to sit with Mary while they tend to work. Once they arrive home, however, they find the Mrs. Hathaway tied up and gagged and the apartment ransacked, apparently by the dealers demanding the heroin. Mary is safe, however. The men continue with their care of Mary, adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her, until Jack returns. Once Jack returns, Peter and Michael question him about the entire drug deal and Mary. Jack replies that he knew nothing about the drugs and initially denies everything about Mary until he reads the note from the mother, named Sylvia. He then recalls the affair that eventually led to Mary being born. Peter and Michael do not hesitate in taking their revenge and passing all responsibility of looking after Mary to Jack, but Jack quickly grows to love his daughter. Later, Peter discovers in the mail a news clipping of Jack's director friend being hospitalized after a mugging (presumably by the drug dealers), with a handwritten note, 'don't let this happen to you'. They formulate a plan to meet and trap the dealers when they negotiate a deal to deliver the illicit goods. With a recording of the conversation, the men prove their innocence to Melkowitz and the dealers are arrested. By now, the three men have fully embraced their role as Mary's guardians. However, one morning, Sylvia (Nancy Travis) arrives, asking for Mary back intending to take her to England to live with her family. Handing her over, the three quickly find themselves miserable and desperately missing Mary. Deciding to stop Sylvia and Mary from leaving, they rush to the airport to try and persuade Sylvia to stay, but they arrive just as her plane leaves. Defeated, the men return to their apartment, where they find both Sylvia and Mary. Sylvia explains she doesn't want to give up her career but can't do this if she has to raise Mary alone, so Peter quickly invites her and Mary to move into their apartment with them with Jack and Michael's agreement, and she agrees."
The Kingdom,"During a softball game at an American oil company housing compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda terrorists set off a bomb, killing Americans and Saudis. While one team hijacks a car and shoots residents, a suicide bomber wearing a fake police uniform blows himself up, killing everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham of the Saudi State Police kills the carjackers. The FBI Legal Attaché in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Fran Manner, calls his US colleague, Special Agent Ronald Fleury, to advise him about the attack. Manner is discussing the situation with DSS Special Agent Rex Bura when an ambulance full of explosives is detonated, killing Manner, Bura, and many others. At FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack. Although the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department hinder FBI efforts to investigate the attack, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team into Saudi Arabia. Fleury gathers Special Agent Janet Mayes, a forensic examiner, FBI analyst Adam Leavitt, an intelligence analyst, and Special Agent Grant Sykes, a bomb technician, to go to Saudi Arabia. On arrival they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi, the commander of the Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound. The investigation is being run by General Al Abdulmalik of the SANG, who does not give Fleury and his team permission to investigate. The FBI team is invited to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled for a dinner. While at the palace, Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation. With this change in leadership, the Americans are allowed hands-on access to the crime scene. While searching for evidence, Sergeant Haytham and Sykes discover the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance. Fleury learns the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. Colonel al-Ghazi orders a special forces team to raid a house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. Following the raid, the team discovers clues, including photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh. Soon afterward, the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt notifies Fleury and his team that they have been ordered to return to the United States. On their way to King Khalid International Airport, their convoy is attacked and incapacitated. Leavitt is dragged out of the wrecked car and kidnapped while Fleury manages to wound one attacker. Al-Ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth SUV and the other car holding Leavitt into the dangerous Al-Suwaidi neighborhood of Riyadh. As they pull up, a gunman launches rocket-propelled grenades at them and a fierce firefight starts. Leavitt is tied up inside a complex. While Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment. After they enter, Mayes comforts a girl in the apartment and offers her candy. In return, the girl offers Mayes a marble, similar to those embedded in the bodies of some bombing victims. Al-Ghazi sees the grandfather, reaches out with his hand, and offers to help him stand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms. At al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham meet his family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the United States, where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace for their outstanding work. Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had whispered to her to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own daughter what her grandfather whispered to her as he was dying. The granddaughter tells her mother, ""Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all,"" a similar line to what Fleury had whispered to Mayes."
Desperate Hours,"In Utah, Nancy Breyers is a defense lawyer who is inexplicably in love with client Michael Bosworth, an intelligent and sociopathic convict. During a break from a courtroom hearing, Nancy sneaks a gun to Bosworth. After Bosworth snaps a guard's neck, Bosworth and Nancy slip away. Bosworth tears at Nancy's clothing and leaves her behind, where she will tell authorities Bosworth held her at gunpoint during his escape. He speeds off in a car with his brother Wally, and their partner, the hulking, half-witted Albert, then changes cars with one Nancy has left for him in a remote location. In the meantime, decorated Vietnam veteran Tim Cornell arrives at his former home with his ex-wife Nora, who has two kids—15-year-old May and her 8-year-old brother Zack. Tim and Nora separated due to his infidelity with a younger woman, and Tim shows up trying to reconcile with Nora, with whom he is still in love. Needing a hideout until Nancy can catch up with them, the Bosworth brothers and Albert settle on the Cornells' home with a ""For Sale"" sign which is seemingly picked by Bosworth at random. Bosworth picks up intimate details of the Cornells, and one by one all of them find themselves the prisoners of the Bosworth brothers and Albert. Nancy's innocent act does not fool FBI agent Brenda Chandler, who puts surveillance on her every move. Nancy eventually cuts a deal with Chandler to have charges against her reduced by betraying Bosworth. As young Zack tries to escape through a window, a friend of the Cornells who visits the house by chance meets him. Bosworth makes the family friend enter inside by force, and as they talk, Bosworth shoots him, then makes Albert dispose of the body as Albert gets anxiety-ridden and decides to go off on his own. As Albert leaves while covered in blood, he intercepts two college girls, who expose his presence to a small gas station owner. The owner calls the authorities who chase after Albert. Albert ignores their order to surrender and is killed by the police on a river bank. Nancy begs Agent Chandler to give her a gun, but unbeknownst to Nancy, Chandler removes the bullets. As she goes to the Cornells' house, the house gets surrounded, and as a shootout starts by Bosworth, Wally is fatally wounded in a barrage of FBI bullets and falls on top of a shocked Nancy. Wally's gun is taken away by Tim. Bosworth holds a gun on Nora and is prepared to use it if Tim interferes. He is unaware that Tim has removed the bullets. Tim then drags the criminal outside, where Bosworth ignores the FBI's order to surrender, and is fatally shot."
Ambulance,"Afghanistan veteran Will Sharp, desperately in need of $231,000 for his wife, Amy's, surgery, reaches out to Danny, his adoptive brother and a life-long criminal, who talks him into taking part in a $32 million bank heist. Though initially hesitant, Will agrees after Danny reaffirms that he is doing this for Amy. The plan nearly succeeds until Officer Zach, who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, discovers the situation and is held hostage by Danny. A shootout then occurs between one of the heist members and Zach's partner Officer Mark. The Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny, who retreat toward the garage. Zach attempts to escape and during a scuffle between him and Danny, is accidentally shot by Will. Leaving Zach to die, the brothers attempt to exit through the back of the building but find it surrounded by police. They then hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson on board, who is treating the injured Zach. After a chase that leads them into an alleyway, Cam makes a desperate attempt to escape using a fire extinguisher but is quickly recaptured by Danny. SIS Captain Monroe arrives on the scene and deploys helicopters to chase after the ambulance. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach, much to his confusion and frustration. Danny then calls Papi, one of his father's criminal friends, for help losing the police in exchange for $8 million. When Cam stops Danny from shooting Mark, who has been chasing them, Danny threatens to throw her off the ambulance. The police are forced to retreat when it is discovered that Monroe's dog is inside Mark's police vehicle. FBI Agent Anson Clark, a past friend of Danny's, is put on the case. Zach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, begins to perform surgery on Zach. Despite her inexperience and a ruptured spleen, Cam successfully performs the surgery. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny, to no avail. Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life. Clark calls Cam and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers. Danny, having had enough of Cam, decides to shoot her, but Will intervenes, causing the brothers to fight about their predicament. They later partially reconcile and listen to music together to ease the tension. In the Los Angeles River, helicopters chase the ambulance as Danny shoots at them. Will and Danny then drive on the opposite lane of the interstate, creating multiple accidents. On Papi's orders, his son, Roberto, drives an empty ambulance towards the police after filling it with C-4 explosives and deploys machine guns on separate cars to cause additional damage, which ends up wounding Monroe in the crossfire. Mark chases down Roberto and fatally shoots him after a scuffle, leaving Papi angry and distraught. Will and Danny escape to Papi's hideout. Papi demands the brothers leave Zach and Cam with them to deal with; Will refuses to cooperate and teams up with Danny to kill Papi and his crew. In the chaos, Cam accidentally shoots Will using Zach's gun. Danny takes the ambulance to a hospital and discovers Zach's gun. He is enraged when Cam reveals that she was the one who shot Will. Danny vows to kill Cam along with himself on live television before confronting the police. Left with no other choice, Will shoots Danny in the back. Danny apologizes to Will before he dies from his injuries. The police arrest a heavily injured Will and take him inside for surgery, Cam secretly gives some of the heist money to Amy for her surgery, and Zach, when questioned by the police about his injuries, tells them that Will saved his life."
Under the Skin,"In Glasgow, a motorcyclist retrieves an inert young woman from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van from town to town, picking up men. She lures a man into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss. At a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer, but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple attempting to rescue their dog, as it is pulled out to sea. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach. The woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man. At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough. The next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased by another man in traffic. She listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman enters a dark room and is examined by the motorcyclist. She seduces a lonely man with facial tumours but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists. In the Scottish Highlands, the woman abandons the van in the fog.

State of Play,"In Washington, D.C., fleeing thief Deshaun Stagg is shot dead by a man carrying a metal briefcase. A passing witness is also shot and left in a coma. The next morning, Congressional aide Sonia Baker is killed by a Washington Metro train. Reporter Cal McAffrey of the Washington Globe newspaper investigates the shootings while his junior colleague Della Frye probes Baker's death. Baker was chief researcher for Congressman Stephen Collins' investigation into private defense contractor PointCorp. Collins tells McAffrey, his friend and college roommate, that he had been having an affair with Baker and did not believe she was suicidal. Frye questions McAffrey about Collins' relationship with Baker; McAffrey suggests she review the Metro CCTV footage, which proves fruitless. McAffrey finds Baker's number in Stagg's phone. A homeless girl named Mandi seeks out McAffrey to sell him items from a bag stolen by Stagg; they include covert photographs of Baker meeting a well-dressed man and a gun with handmade hollow point bullets. McAffrey sends Frye to the hospital, where the witness is coming out of his coma, while he visits Collins' wife Anne, with whom he had previously had an affair. Before Frye can talk to the witness, he is killed by a sniper. She realizes she saw the same man at the hospital and in the metro footage. Collins confirms to McAffrey that PointCorp is secretly the power behind other contractors, thus seeking a virtual monopoly on foreign and domestic government defense and security contracts. If McAffrey can prove that PointCorp had Baker killed, Collins will go public with his findings. A PointCorp insider gives McAffrey an address, where McAffrey encounters the assassin, who shoots at him before fleeing. Detective Donald Bell informs McAffrey that Mandi has been found murdered. Baker's flatmate Rhonda Silver identifies the well-dressed man as Dominic Foy, a PR executive at a subsidiary of PointCorp. Silver also says she had a threesome with Baker and Collins and that Collins paid off a $40,000 debt of Baker's. McAffrey resists Frye's urge to publish (believing Silver to be lying), and Globe editor Cameron Lynne is furious when the story is published elsewhere instead. McAffrey convinces Foy that he is in danger and can best protect himself by talking on the record. Foy reveals that Baker was being paid $26,000 a month to spy on Collins for PointCorp, but had fallen in love and was pregnant with Collins' baby. She was killed when she refused to continue spying. McAffrey plays the tape of the interview to Collins, who lashes out at McAffrey for not telling him in person about the pregnancy. He accuses McAffrey of caring about his story above their friendship and storms off. That evening, McAffrey confronts Congressman George Fergus, the chief whip who had mentored Collins and recommended Baker to him. He informs Fergus he plans to run a story about Fergus' link with PointCorp and his undermining of Collins's investigation. At the Globe offices, Lynne refuses to run the story without named sources on the record when Collins and his wife Anne come in. Collins confirms the story on PointCorp, his affair with Baker, and his belief that PointCorp had Baker killed. Anne tells McAffrey that Baker slept with her husband ""for $26,000 a month"". As the story is going to press, McAffrey realizes the specific sum was never mentioned to Collins. He recognizes the assassin as ""Robert Bingham"" in a military photograph featuring Collins. He leaves, telling Frye to tell Cameron to hold the story. He confronts Collins, who confirms that Bingham is an unstable veteran whose life he saved in Kuwait and whom he asked to follow Baker once he became suspicious of her. He says he never asked him to kill her and initially thought, as did McAffrey, that PointCorp had done it. McAffrey says this is not about Fergus or PointCorp, but about decisions Collins made that resulted in four deaths. McAffrey reveals he has already called the police. Leaving the building, McAffrey is confronted by Bingham as Bell and the police arrive. Bingham attempts to kill McAffrey but is shot dead by the police. Back at the Globe, McAffrey types up the story headlined ""Congressman Implicated in Murders"". He puts Frye first on the byline and has her submit the story for publication, and the two leave together."
Mute Witness,"Billy Hughes, a special effects make-up artist who is mute, is in Moscow working on a low-budget slasher film directed by Andy Clarke, the boyfriend of her elder sister, Karen. On one particular night, Billy returns to the set to fetch a piece of equipment for the next day's shoot when she is accidentally locked in the studio. Billy phones Karen for help and communicates with her via morse code, but is interrupted when she discovers a small film crew working after-hours to shoot a cheap pornographic film. Watching unseen, Billy is amused until the performed sex becomes sadistic. When Arkadi, the masked actor, pulls out a knife and brutally stabs the actress to death, Billy reacts and is discovered. She flees through the studio, pursued by the film's director, Lyosha, before crashing through a window outside. Moments later, Karen arrives and finds the injured Billy, with Lyosha standing over her. Lyosha pretends to be an innocent bystander who witnessed Billy's accident, but Karen senses he is dangerous based on Billy's body language. Police arrive and question Lyosha, but come to the conclusion that Billy witnessed an elaborate special effects sequence being shot when they are unable to find a body. Arkadi, the man whom Billy witnessed stab the actress, demonstrates the effects using a fake knife that streams blood, frightening Andy when he pretends to attack him with it. Billy insists the prop knife is hers, and that Arkadi stole it. Billy leads police to an elevator shaft where she believes Lyosha stashed the actress's corpse, but they find it empty. After police dismiss the incident and send Billy home, a night watchman at the studio finds the actress's corpse burning in a basement incinerator before being stabbed to death by Arkadi. Shortly after, a mysterious elderly man arrives at the studio in a vintage car, and asks Lyosha if things ""went smoothly."" Aware that Billy witnessed the murder, the Reaper makes clear that she must be eliminated. Meanwhile, a detective, Aleksander Larsen, begins looking into Billy's claim, believing there to be some truth to it, as rumors have circulated about an international crime ring making and selling snuff films in Moscow. The operation is led by a wealthy financier known as ""the Reaper."" Back at her apartment, Billy communicates with Karen using a digital phone dictation machine. In the midst of her conversation, Billy's doorbell rings, and she is confronted by Arkadi, who breaks in, followed by Lyosha. A violent struggle ensues, during which Billy manages to electrocute Arkadi in the bathtub with a hairdryer. Lyosha subsequently incapacitates Billy, only to be saved by Larsen, who beats Lyosha unconscious. Larsen quickly escorts Billy away, and explains that the crime ring have targeted her, believing she is in possession of a computer disc containing confidential information. Meanwhile, Karen and Alex arrive at Billy's apartment only to find it disheveled, and they are subsequently attacked by Lyosha, who awakens. Two of the Reaper's thugs posing as policemen arrive at the scene, and they shoot and kill Lyosha before questioning Karen and Alex about the computer disc. Meanwhile, Billy directs Larsen to the film studio, where she believes the computer disc is located. Karen and Andy meanwhile also rush to the studio, where Andy attempts to shoot at Larsen as he arrives with Billy, believing Larsen means her harm. In the melee, Billy rushes outside only to be confronted by numerous armed thugs, along with the Reaper. Moments later, Larsen shoots Billy multiple times, apparently killing her, before proffering the Reaper the sought-after computer disc. The Reaper and his thugs promptly depart, after which Karen begins to violently beat Larsen for killing her sister. However, Karen quickly realizes that Billy is still alive as she opens her eyes and brandishes a bulletproof vest; Larsen orchestrated the fake murder to divert the Reaper and spare Billy's life. Larsen makes plans to meet Billy the following day, and brings with him one of the studio's corrupt security guards, whom he has bound and gagged. As they are about to drive away, Billy observes the guard's worried expression, and realizes the car has been fixed with a bomb. With Alex's help, she manages to communicate this, and Larsen escapes the vehicle seconds before it explodes, saving himself."
Face_Off,"FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has a personal vendetta against civil freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after Castor killed Archer's son Michael while trying to assassinate Archer. Archer learns of Castor's brother, Pollux Troy (played by Alessandro Nivola), making arrangements for a private jet, and sets a trap to capture both Castor and Pollux. After an intense firefight, Archer corners Castor, who gloats about a bomb he has planted somewhere in Los Angeles, but he is knocked into a coma after he tries to pull a knife on Archer. Although the plans for the bomb are found in Pollux's suitcase, Archer has no clue to its location. At the request of a Special ops agent, he reluctantly agrees to undergo an experimental face transplant surgery, giving him the appearance of Castor; this process is only known to Archer's partner and close friend Tito, and the surgeon conducting the procedure, Dr. Malcolm Walsh. The medical operation is a success: Archer's hair, muscles and other necessary physical parts are altered into Castor's and his face is switched with Castor's, whose now faceless head is bandaged and Archer's face is stored in a tank of water. Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage) is taken to an offshore high security penitentiary, Erewhon Prison, and meets with Pollux, eventually gaining his confidence to learn the bomb's location. Shortly after Archer gets the information he needs from Pollux, he is surprised when he is visited by Castor (now played by John Travolta), who has forced Dr. Walsh to give him Archer's face, then killed him and everyone with knowledge of the transplant surgery, and now plans to abuse Archer's job, his wife Eve (played by Joan Allen) and teenage daughter Jamie. With Archer's face, Castor releases Pollux from prison by having him ""confess"" the location of their bomb so that Castor can ""locate"" it and play hero by disarming it single-handedly. Castor's offbeat personality earns him respect that Archer never received, as Archer is more prone to ruining celebrations with reminders of the loss of life involved. Simultaneously, Archer escapes from Erewhon by staging a jailbreak, taking out several guards on the way. By this point, both men begin to see how their pursuits of each other affect the people around them. Castor is much more affectionate and tender with Eve, even beating up a boy who attempts to rape Jamie, and also figures out that Jamie has never forgiven her father for failing to protect them after her brother's death. Meanwhile, Archer visits Castor's bomb supplier Dietrich Hassler (Nick Cassavettes) and his sister, Castor's ex-girlfriend Sasha (Gina Gershon), and finds that Sasha's son Adam, whom he earlier had threatened to put in child protective services, is also Castor's child. Archer finds Sasha to be a caring mother trying to raise her son all alone in rough conditions and feels bad for threatening her earlier. When Castor learns of the prison break, he realizes that Archer will connect with his gang, and leads an FBI raid of his headquarters. An intense shootout ensues in which most of Castor's old network is killed, including Pollux, and Archer is seriously wounded. The next day, Castor is berated by the FBI Assistant Director in Charge Victor Lazarro (Harve Presnell), then kills Lazarro in a fit of rage and makes it look like a heart attack. Castor himself is promoted to acting Assistant Director in Charge, making him virtually untouchable. Meanwhile, Archer returns to his home and convinces Eve, a doctor herself, that he is Archer, which she later confirms via a blood sample she takes from Castor while he is sleeping. She helps tend to his wounds, and explains that Castor will be at Lazarro's funeral the next day. Archer waits to confront Castor after the funeral, but finds that Castor has taken Eve hostage. A gunfight ensues between Castor, Archer and Castor's gang, under Archer's orders. Sasha helps rescue Eve, but takes a bullet in protecting Archer; he promises to look after Adam as she dies. Castor attempts to take Jamie hostage, but she retaliates by stabbing him in his thigh with a butterfly knife that Castor had taught her how to use. Castor tries to escape using a nearby speedboat, followed closely by Archer. The two boats crash ashore, and the two men turn to melee. Castor, finding himself being overpowered, attempts to damage Archer's own face on himself as to make it unusable by Archer, but Archer kills him using a spear gun. As the FBI arrive, Eve is able to explain Archer's true identity. With the face transplant surgery reversed, Archer (once again played by John Travolta) returns to his family, helping to welcome Adam into his family, fulfilling his promise to Sasha."

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, has set up a new base on the ice planet Hoth. The Imperial fleet, led by a merciless Darth Vader, hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching probe droids across the galaxy. Luke Skywalker is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe, but manages to escape from its lair using the Force and his lightsaber. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and manages to keep him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead Tauntaun mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning. The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with C-3PO and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amidst tension and briefly kiss. Several bounty hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the Falcon. Meanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice. Luke learns more about the Force from Yoda, who lifts his X-wing out of the swamp using the Force. After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet Bespin, which is governed by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Bounty hunter Boba Fett tracks the Falcon and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the dark side of the Force. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them. Intending to hold Luke in suspended animation by imprisoning him in carbonite, Vader selects Han to be frozen as an experiment. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from Jabba the Hutt. Lando, experiencing a change of heart, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. They fight their way back to the Falcon and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs from an antenna. He reaches out telepathically to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by TIE fighters towards Vader on his Star Destroyer, but R2-D2 reactivates the Falcon's hyperdrive, allowing them to escape. Luke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a robotic prosthesis. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other rebels watch the Falcon depart."
Driving Miss Daisy,"In 1948, Daisy Werthan, or Miss Daisy, a 72-year-old wealthy, Jewish, widowed, retired schoolteacher, lives alone in Atlanta, Georgia, except for a black housekeeper, Idella. When Miss Daisy drives her 1946 Chrysler Windsor into her neighbor's yard, her 40-year-old son, Boolie, buys her a 1949 Hudson Commodore and hires 60-year-old Hoke Colburn, a black chauffeur. Boolie claims to Hoke that Miss Daisy may not appreciate his efforts, but she cannot fire him, as Boolie himself is his employer. Miss Daisy at first refuses to let anyone drive her, but Hoke convinces her to be driven. She reluctantly accepts the first two trips, but tries to get Boolie to fire Hoke after discovering a can of salmon missing from her pantry. However, she relents when Hoke, unprompted and before she is able to confront him, admits to eating the salmon and offers her a replacement can he had bought. As Miss Daisy and Hoke spend time together, she gains appreciation for his many skills and teaches him to read for the first time using her teaching skills and resources. After Idella dies in the spring of 1963, rather than hire a new housekeeper, Miss Daisy decides to care for her own house and have Hoke do the cooking and the driving.

The film explores racism against black people, which affects Hoke personally. The film also depicts antisemitism in the South. After her synagogue is bombed, Miss Daisy realizes that she is also a victim of prejudice. However, American society is undergoing radical changes, and Miss Daisy attends a dinner at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gives a speech. She initially invites Boolie to the dinner, but he declines, and suggests that Miss Daisy invite Hoke.

50_50,"Mild-mannered Adam Lerner is a 27-year-old public radio journalist in Seattle. His best friend Kyle, who is rather crude, disapproves of his girlfriend Rachael, an artist. After experiencing severe pains in his back, Adam is diagnosed with schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma, a cancerous tumor in his spine, and must undergo chemotherapy. He sees on the Internet that the survival rate for his diagnosis is 50/50. After Adam reveals this, his emotional mother, Diane, who nurses her Alzheimer's-stricken husband Richard, offers to care for him, but Adam declines as Rachael has already promised to do so. At one of his treatments, Adam meets Mitch and Alan, two older cancer patients also undergoing chemo, and they become friends, bonding through cannabis-laced macaroons. Rachael is uncomfortable during his treatments and is often late picking him up. She also gets him a retired racing greyhound named Skeletor as a pet. Throughout Adam's struggle, Kyle attempts to keep up his morale, helping Adam shave his head and using his friend's illness to pick up women. While on a date, Kyle sees Rachael kissing another man at a gallery and later forces her to confess her infidelity to Adam, who breaks up with her. He follows Kyle's suggestion, and they use his illness to pick up two women at a bar. Meanwhile, Adam is being treated by a young, inexperienced therapist, Katherine McKay, a PhD candidate doing the clinical aspect of her thesis at the hospital. While their relationship and sessions begin unevenly, he slowly begins to open up to her. After she drives him home after a chemo session, they develop a rapport, blurring their professional and personal relationship. She helps Adam understand his mother's situation: loved ones can feel just as much stress as the patient, which helps Adam repair the rift between him and his mother. When Mitch dies, Adam's mortality hits him, causing him to lash out at Katherine verbally, and shortly thereafter, he is informed that he needs to undergo risky surgery. The night before the operation, Adam argues with an intoxicated Kyle, demanding that he let him drive his car even though he has never learned and has no driver's license. After a near miss, Adam breaks down and berates Kyle for seemingly not taking his condition seriously and using it for his own gain. Adam then calls Katherine and tells her he wishes she was his girlfriend, but he also says he is tired of being sick and just wants his cancer to be over. That night, dropping off Kyle (who was too drunk to drive), Adam finds the book Facing Cancer Together from their trip to a bookstore where Kyle picked up a shop clerk. The book is filled with notes, highlighted paragraphs, and turned-down pages. He realizes that Kyle sincerely cares about him and has been earnestly trying to help him since his diagnosis. The next day, Kyle drops Adam off at the hospital, where Adam embraces him for being a good friend and apologizes for the previous night. After saying his tearful farewells to his family, he undergoes surgery. Katherine goes to the waiting room and inadvertently meets Adam's parents and Kyle during the wait. After the surgery, they are told that although the bone degradation was worse than they believed, the surgeons removed the tumor successfully, and Adam will recover. Sometime later, he is preparing for a date with Katherine, while Kyle encourages him and bandages the incision on his back. After Kyle leaves, Katherine asks, ""Now what?"" and Adam smiles, finally free of cancer."
15 Minutes,"Ex-convicts Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or in the Czech Republic). Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share, so Emil fatally stabs him and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga) witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before they can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator assigned to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a flamboyant New York City detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity that he is followed around by a reporter from a tabloid TV show, Top Story, hosted by the arrogant Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer). Everywhere he goes, citizens cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears. Emil calls an escort service and asks for a ""Czech girl."" One calling herself Honey (Noelle Evans) arrives, whom he kills but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. He continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder, visiting the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron), who runs it, tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices someone filming them from across the street. A foot chase begins, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson (Avery Brooks) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He is jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything. On the night Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains his plan to Flemming: He will kill him and sell the tape to Top Story. After being committed to an insane asylum, he will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties from his books and movies. Fleming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow. The entire city is in mourning. Emil calls Hawkins to offer a tape of the killing that he is willing to sell to Top Story. Hawkins pays him $1 million for it. Warsaw and the entire police force are furious, unable to believe that the TV show would air it, especially since Hawkins's main reporter is Nicolette. Emil and Oleg sit in a Planet Hollywood to watch the show in public. Halfway through the broadcast, customers realize that Emil and Oleg are right there with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Instead of delivering his suspect to the police station, Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him. Other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving. While the lawyer is leading Emil away, surrounded by the media, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the Top Story crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, who is covering the story, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder. An officer observes that Oleg is still alive. Hawkins rushes to his side, where Oleg says a final few words about the movie that is still being taped,  just before he dies. Hawkins attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval."
Cold Mountain,"When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate States Army. Among them is W.P. Inman, a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada Monroe, a preacher's daughter who had come from Charleston, South Carolina to care for her ailing father. Their whirlwind courtship is interrupted by the war, but they share their first kiss the day Inman leaves for the army. Before parting ways, Ada promises Inman that she will wait for him. Three years later, Inman fights in the Battle of the Crater and survives; he then comforts a dying acquaintance from Cold Mountain, while fellow soldier Stobrod Thewes plays a tune on his fiddle. Inman is later wounded in a skirmish; as he lies in a hospital near death, a nurse reads him a letter from Ada, who pleads for Inman to come home to her. Inman recovers and deserts, embarking on a long trek back to Cold Mountain. Inman encounters a corrupt preacher named Veasey, who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later joins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named Junior dispose of a bull cadaver, and then join him and his sordid family for dinner. Junior leaves and returns with the Confederate Home Guard, who take Inman and Veasey away along with other deserters. During a skirmish with Union cavalry, Veasey and the group are killed while Inman is left for dead; an elderly hermit living in the woods finds Inman and nurses him back to health. Inman eventually meets a grieving young widow named Sara and her infant child Ethan, and stays the night at her cabin. The next morning, three Union soldiers arrive demanding food; they take Sara and Ethan hostage, forcing Inman to kill two of them, while an enraged Sara fatally shoots the last one trying to flee. Back in Cold Mountain, Ada's father has died, leaving her with no money and few means to run their property's farm in Black Cove. She survives on the kindness of her neighbors, particularly Esco and Sally Swanger, who eventually send for Ruby Thewes—Stobrod's daughter—to help. Ruby moves in and together they bring the farm to working order, becoming close friends. Meanwhile, Ada writes constant letters to Inman in hopes of meeting him again and renewing their romance. Ada has several tense encounters with Captain Teague, the leader of the local Home Guard who covets Ada and her property, and whose grandfather had once owned much of Cold Mountain. One day, Teague and his men kill Esco, and then torture Sally to coax her deserter sons out of hiding and kill them as well. Ada and Ruby rescue Sally, who is traumatized and rendered mute. The women celebrate Christmas with Stobrod, who has deserted and arrived to Cold Mountain with traveling companions Pangle, a simple-minded banjo player, and Georgia, a mandolin player to whom Ruby is attracted. While camping in the woods one night, Stobrod and Pangle are cornered by Teague and the Guard while Georgia watches from hiding; Pangle unintentionally reveals the musicians are deserters, and the Guard shoot Pangle and Stobrod. Georgia escapes and informs Ruby and Ada, who return to the scene to find Pangle dead and Stobrod badly wounded. The women remove a bullet from Stobrod's back, and they take shelter in an abandoned Cherokee camp. Ada goes hunting for food and is reunited with Inman, who has finally returned to Cold Mountain. They return to the camp, and spend the night consummating their love for one another. Leaving Inman and Stobrod to hide at the camp, Ada and Ruby are surrounded by Teague and his men, having captured and tortured Georgia for their whereabouts. Inman arrives and kills Teague and most of his band in a gunfight. He then chases Teague's lieutenant, Bosie, and exchanges fast draws; Bosie is killed, but Inman is mortally wounded. Ada finds and comforts Inman, who dies in her arms. Years later, it is revealed that Ada's night with Inman had produced a daughter, Grace Inman, and that Ruby has married Georgia bearing two children. With Stobrod and Sally, the family celebrates Easter together at Black Cove."
War Horse,"In 1912, a bay Thoroughbred is born in Devon, England. At auction, farmer Ted Narracott outbids his landlord Lyons for the colt, to the dismay of his wife Rose, because the family needs a working horse that can plough the field. Their son Albert, accompanied by his best friend Andrew, names the colt Joey, and teaches him to come when he imitates an owl's call. The pair form a close bond. Against all odds, the horse and boy successfully plough a rocky field, saving the family's farm. Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War, and gives him Ted's regimental pennant, confiding in Albert that his father carries physical and mental scars from the war. In 1914, as war with Germany is declared, a heavy downpour ruins the family's crops, forcing Ted to sell Joey to the army. Albert is heartbroken and tries to stop the sale but is too late. Captain James Nicholls sees Albert's attachment and promises to look after the steed. Albert tries to enlist but is too young, and before the company departs, he ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle and promises the horse that he will find him. Joey bonds with Topthorn, a black horse with whom he is trained for his military role. The horses are deployed to Flanders with a flying column under the command of Nicholls and Major Jamie Stewart. They lead a cavalry charge through a German encampment, but the unit is decimated by machine gun fire. Nicholls is killed along with almost all his fellow cavalrymen; the Germans capture the horses. Gunther, a young German soldier, is assigned to the care of Joey and Topthorn. When his brother Michael is sent to the front line, Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert. The German army soon tracks down the boys and they are shot for desertion; however, the Germans leave without noticing the horses. They are found by a French girl named Emilie. German soldiers arrive at her grandfather's farm, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. For her birthday, Emilie's grandfather allows her to ride Joey; they run into the Germans, who confiscate the horses. Emilie's grandfather keeps the pennant. By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the Second Battle of the Somme. After a British charge into no man's land, Albert and Andrew miraculously make it across to the German trench, where a gas bomb explodes. The Germans use Joey and Topthorn to haul artillery, under the care of Private Henglemann. He tries to care for them as best as he can and eventually tries to free them, but Topthorn succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Joey escapes, narrowly evading an oncoming Mark IV tank, and gallops into no man's land where he becomes entangled in barbed wire. Colin, a British soldier, makes his way to Joey under a white flag and tries to free him. Peter, a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they rescue Joey and remark on the remorseless war. To decide who should take the horse, they flip a coin; Colin wins and guides the injured Joey to the British trench. Andrew is killed by the gas attack but Albert survives, temporarily blinded. While recuperating, he hears about the ""miraculous horse"" rescued from no-man's land. Just as Joey is about to be put down by a doctor who deems Joey too injured to recover, he hears Albert's owl call. Albert, his eyes still bandaged, is able to describe Joey in perfect detail, and the two are reunited. The doctor decides to nurse Joey back to health. World War I ends, and Joey is ordered to be auctioned, just like all the other warhorses.  Albert's comrades raise a collection to bid for the horse as they fear he might be sold to a butcher. They seem to outbid the butcher but eventually the auction is won by Emilie's grandfather, who tells Albert that Emilie has died and the horse is all he has left of her. However, after Albert pleads with him, the old man recognizes the strength of the soldier's bond, and returns the pennant and Joey to Albert, as ""Emilie would have wanted."" Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, embracing his mother and returning the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends his hand to the boy, now a man and like him, a former soldier. Joey watches on, seemingly with pride."
Fury,"In April 1945, the Western Allied invasion of Germany is encountering strong resistance. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier, a battle-hardened staff sergeant in the U.S. Second Armored Division, commands an M4 Sherman nicknamed Fury whose crew of gunner Boyd ""Bible"" Swan, loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis, driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia, and assistant driver–bow gunner ""Red"" have been together since the North African campaign. After Red is killed in a tank battle, he is replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, a young typist clerk from V Corps. As Fury moves deeper into Germany, the crew develops a disdain for Norman's combat inexperience and aversion to violence. While moving in a convoy, he spots but does not fire upon a group of concealed Hitler Youth child soldiers, who promptly ambush the tank column with a Panzerfaust, destroying the lead tank and killing the platoon leader and his crew. Later, he hesitates under fire from anti-tank guns. After a battle, Don orders Norman to execute a captured German soldier. When he refuses, Don wrestles his revolver into Norman's hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the soldier and traumatizing Norman. After the platoon captures a small town, Don takes Norman to help search and clear an apartment, where they discover two German women – Irma and her younger cousin Emma – in hiding. After Don gives them some supplies, the women begin preparing a hot meal and give Don hot water for a shave. As they begin to bond, Norman and Emma retreat to the bedroom and have sex, having been prompted to do so by Don. Later, as the four sit down to eat together, the rest of Fury's crew drunkenly barges in, harassing the women and bullying Norman. The crew's resentment towards Norman leads to a tense standoff with Don before they all are called away for an urgent mission. As they depart, German artillery strikes the town and kills Emma, causing Norman to suffer a mental breakdown. Tank crews occupying the town receive orders to hold a vital crossroads to protect the division's vulnerable rear lines. En route, a lone German Tiger I ambushes and wipes out the entire platoon before being defeated by Fury. The radio gets damaged in the battle, preventing Don from calling for reinforcements. Don decides that he and his crew must continue the mission alone. When they arrive at the crossroads, Fury is immobilized by a landmine. While the tank is being repaired, Don sends Norman to scout a nearby hill, where he spots a battalion of Waffen-SS marching towards Fury's position. He returns to inform the crew and they make plans to retreat, but ultimately stay to help Don hold the crossroads after he refuses to leave. The men disguise Fury to make it appear destroyed and then hide inside. While they wait to make their final stand, Norman is nicknamed ""Machine"" as the crew members finally express their acceptance of him. They then ambush the Germans, inflicting heavy casualties. As a vicious and protracted battle ensues, Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust shot that penetrates the turret; Gordo is shot while unpinning a grenade and falls back into the tank with it, subsequently sacrificing himself by covering it with his body as it explodes; and Bible is shot in the head by small-arms fire. Don is then shot by a sniper and retreats into the tank. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Don tells Norman to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, and Don is killed. As he tries to conceal himself underneath the tank, Norman is spotted by a young Waffen-SS soldier, who does not alert the battalion and moves on. Waking up the next morning, Norman crawls back into the tank and mourns over Don's corpse before covering him with his jacket and taking his revolver. He is then rescued by a group of American soldiers and heralded as a hero. While he is driven away in an ambulance, he looks back at Fury's carcass as American troops continue their advance. The final overhead image shows Fury surrounded by hundreds of dead Waffen-SS soldiers."
Land of Mine,"Following the end of World War II in Europe and the liberation of Denmark from German occupation in May 1945, the Wehrmacht and SS occupiers became prisoners of war. A group of young German prisoners are sent to the west coast where they are trained to use their bare hands to remove the landmines that the Germans had buried in the sand. After their training, the boys left under the charge of Danish sergeant Carl Leopold Rasmussen who is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy. Marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. One of the boys, Sebastian Schumann, attempts to remain optimistic as they discuss their plans for when they return home. The POWs are given little food due to post-war shortages and begin to suffer from malnourishment, with Ernst befriending a young local girl to steal some bread from her. One day, while diffusing a mine, Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he later dies in a field hospital. Most of the boys become ill after eating grain contaminated with rat faeces that they found on a nearby farm; they are treated by Rasmussen who makes them purge themselves with seawater. Rasmussen gradually treats his charges more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and tries to maintain morale by reporting that Wilhelm has survived. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. Hearing rumours of Rasmussen stealing food for the boys, his commanding officer Captain Ebbe Jensen brings a group of British soldiers to abuse and torment the boys. Rasmussen stops them but is confronted about the theft by Ebbe, who accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. During another day of demining, Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another, leaving his twin brother Ernst distraught. After a casual game of football, Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly cleared zone of the beach. This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. When a young local girl walks out into an uncleared area of beach, her mother comes looking for Rasmussen only to find him gone. The boys volunteer to help save the girl. Ernst walks through the uncleared minefield to keep the little girl calm whilst Sebastian clears a path to safety for her. They manage to rescue her but instead of returning to safety with Sebastian, Ernst decides he cannot go on without his brother and commits suicide by walking into the uncleared section and is promptly killed. After witnessing this act of kindness and bravery from the boys, Rasmussen relents in his treatment of them and reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to go home. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach with Rasmussen, the rest of them are loading unexploded mines onto a truck. When one of the boys tosses a mine that was not properly defused onto the truckbed of deactivated mines, he accidentally sets off a massive explosion which kills himself and his nearby comrades. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain. Although the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, without Rasmussen's knowledge Jensen decides to send the surviving four to join a team defusing landmines in another coastal area. Rasmussen argues in vain for Jensen to rescind the order. He decides to rescue the boys and then drives them within 500 metres of the German border so they can run to their freedom."
All Quiet on the Western Front,"In 1917, three years into World War I, 17-year-old Paul Bäumer enthusiastically enlists in the Imperial German Army alongside friends Albert Kropp, Franz Müller, and Ludwig Behm. They listen to a patriotic speech by a school official and unknowingly receive uniforms from soldiers killed in a previous battle. After they are deployed in Northern France near La Malmaison, they are befriended by Stanislaus ""Kat"" Katczinsky, an older soldier. Their romantic view of the war is shattered by the realities of trench warfare on the Western Front, and Ludwig is killed by artillery on the first night. On November 7, 1918, German State Secretary Matthias Erzberger, weary of mounting losses, meets with German High Command to persuade them to begin armistice talks with the Allied powers. Meanwhile, Paul and Kat steal a goose from a farm to share with Albert, Franz, and another veteran, Tjaden Stackfleet, with whom they have grown close behind the front in Champagne. Kat, who is illiterate, gets Paul to read him a letter from his wife and worries that he will be unable to reintegrate into peacetime society. Franz spends the night with a local French woman and brings back her scarf as a souvenir. On November 9, Erzberger and the German delegation board a train bound for the Forest of Compiègne to negotiate a ceasefire. Paul and his friends go on a mission to find 60 missing recruits sent to reinforce their unit and discover that they were killed by gas after taking off their masks too soon. General Friedrichs, who opposes the armistice talks, orders an attack before French reinforcements arrive. That night, Erzberger's delegation reaches the Forest of Compiègne, and Paul's regiment is sent to the front to prepare to attack the French lines. On November 10, Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch gives the Germans 72 hours to accept the non-negotiable Allied terms. Meanwhile, the German attack takes the French front line after hand-to-hand fighting but is routed by a combined arms counterattack, in which the French use Saint-Chamond tanks to overcome German defenses. Franz is separated from the group, and Albert dies trying to surrender when he is set on fire with a flamethrower. Trapped in a crater in no man's land with a French soldier, Paul stabs him and watches him die slowly, becoming remorseful and asking for forgiveness from his dead body. Erzberger learns of Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication and receives instructions from field marshal Paul von Hindenburg to accept the Allied terms. Paul returns to his unit and sees them celebrating the war's imminent end. He finds a wounded Tjaden, who gives him Franz's scarf, indicating Franz has been killed. Paul and Kat bring him food, but Tjaden, knowing that his injured leg will be amputated, chooses to fatally stab himself in the throat with the fork they brought him rather than live as an amputee. On November 11, Erzberger's delegation signs an armistice set to take effect at 11:00 AM. After learning of the ceasefire, Paul and Kat steal from the farm one last time, but Kat is shot by the farmer's vengeful son and dies before arriving at an infirmary. General Friedrichs, who wants to end the war with at least a German victory out of spite, orders an attack to start at 10:45 AM. Paul kills as many French soldiers as he can before being bayonetted from behind, seconds before 11:00 AM. Paul stumbles out into the trenches and marvels at the end of conflict as he dies from his wound. A short time later, a newly-arrived German recruit that Paul had saved in the combat finds Paul's mud-caked body and picks up Franz's scarf, but not the dog tag that acts as the identifier of dead soldiers. As a result, Paul's death is not recorded."
Ride the High Country,"In the early years of the 20th century, an aging ex-lawman, Steve Judd (Joel McCrea), is hired to transport gold from a high country mining camp to the town of Hornitos, California. Six miners were recently murdered trying to transport their gold on the one trail leading down from the crest of the Sierra Nevada. In his prime, Judd was a tough and respected lawman, but now his threadbare clothes and spectacles serve as reminders that he is long past his prime. Judd enlists the help of his old friend and partner Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott) to guard the gold transfer. Gil, who had been making his living passing himself off as a legendary sharpshooter named The Oregon Kid, enlists the help of his young sidekick, Heck Longtree (Ron Starr). Judd, Gil, and Heck ride up into the mountains toward  Coarsegold (A Sierra foothills town north of Fresno ) mining camp. Judd doesn't know that Gil and Heck are planning to steal the gold for themselves—preferably with Judd's help, but without it if necessary. Along the way they stop for the night at the farm of Joshua Knudsen (R. G. Armstrong) and his daughter Elsa (Mariette Hartley). Knudsen is a domineering religious man who warns against those who ""traffic in gold"" and trades Bible verses with Judd at the dinner table. That night, Elsa and Heck meet in the moonlight, but Knudsen interrupts their conversation. Back at the house, he admonishes and slaps her for her behavior. Unable to tolerate her domineering father any longer, Elsa leaves her home the next morning. She later joins Judd, Gil, and Heck on their ride to Coarse Gold where she intends to marry her fiancé. Along the way she and Heck flirt and he tries to force himself on her but is stopped by Judd. When they reach the Coarse Gold mining camp, they soon discover that the girl's fiancé, Billy Hammond (James Drury), is a drunken lout who intends to prostitute her to his four thuggish brothers, Elder (John Anderson), Sylvus (L. Q. Jones), Jimmy (John Davis Chandler) and Henry (Warren Oates). Judd and Heck rescue the girl from the marriage, and the next morning, Judd, Gil, Heck and Elsa start back towards town with the gold. Along the way, Judd talks to Gil about right and wrong and how that's ""something you just know."" After all the lost years working in disreputable places, he tells Gil that he's now grateful to have gained back some of his self-respect and intends on keeping it ""with the help of you and that boy back there."" When Gil asks if that's all he wants, Judd replies, ""All I want is to enter my House justified."" Realizing Judd will never go along with his plan to steal the gold, Gil plans to steal the gold without his help. During the night as Gil and Heck prepare to leave with the gold, Judd confronts them at gunpoint. Angered by his old friend's betrayal, he slaps him and challenges him to a draw, but Gil throws down his guns. Planning to put them on trial when they return to town, Judd is forced to change his plans when the Hammond brothers appear in hot pursuit of the girl. In the ensuing gunfight, two of the brothers, Jimmy and Sylvus, are killed, and Billy, Elder and Henry escape. During the night, Gil leaves camp and heads back to the site of the gunfight, where he takes a horse and gun from one of the dead brothers. Then he follows Judd, Heck, and Elsa down the only trail. Meanwhile, Heck has shown himself to be trustworthy, and even though he will most likely go to prison, Elsa tells him she'll be there when he gets out. When they reach Elsa's farm, the Hammond brothers are waiting, having already killed her father. A gunfight breaks out and soon both Judd and Heck are wounded. Just then Gil comes riding in to help his old friend, and together the pair insult and challenge the brothers to a face-to-face shootout in the open. When the dust settles, the three brothers are dead, but Judd is mortally wounded. He tells his old friend, ""I don't want them to see this. I'll go it alone."" When Gil pledges to take care of everything just like he would have, Judd says, ""Hell, I know that. I always did. You just forgot it for a while, that's all."" Judd casts a look back towards the high country and then dies.  The film's final shot is of a mountain in the background."
Young Guns,"In 1870s Lincoln County, New Mexico, English cattleman John Tunstall hires a wayward young gunman named William “Billy the Kid” Bonney to join the ""Regulators"" who live and work on his ranch: Doc Scurlock, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Dick Brewer, ""Dirty"" Steve Stephens, and Charlie Bowdre. Tunstall tries to educate and civilize the young men in his employ, and clashes with rival rancher Lawrence Murphy, a well-connected Irishman in league with the corrupt House. One of Murphy's hired hands, McCloskey, joins up with Tunstall, while Doc attempts to court Murphy's Chinese ward, Yen Sun. Murphy's men kill Tunstall, leading his lawyer friend Alexander McSween to arrange for the Regulators to be deputized and given warrants for the killers' arrest. Hotheaded Billy challenges Dick's authority as the group's foreman, as the Regulators attempt to take Murphy's henchmen in alive. Instead, Billy guns down several unarmed men, including McCloskey, whom he suspects of still working for Murphy. Newspapers paint the Regulators as a deadly gang headed by a larger-than-life outlaw, ""Billy the Kid"". With bounty hunters seeking them all over the West and unsure where to go, Chavez leads the others on a peyote trip. One of the men on their warrants, Buckshot Roberts, tracks them down and a shootout ensues. Roberts barricades himself in an outhouse and kills Dick, and as a reaction, the rest of the Regulators shoot up the outhouse. This lead the others to go on the run, while an injured Doc goes his own way. Chavez reveals that Murphy's corruption led to the deaths of his mother and her Navajo tribe, and urges the others to abandon their need for bloodshed, but Billy takes charge as their new leader, determined to avenge Tunstall. Doc visits Yen Sun before rejoining the gang, and they kill the corrupt Sheriff William J. Brady and his men. They meet with a furious Alex, who explains that their badges have been revoked. Though they are now wanted men, Billy insists that their actions will bring attention to Murphy's corruption. While Charlie revisits a brothel, Billy kills an arrogant bounty hunter, and the gang escapes to Mexico, where Charlie marries a local woman. Soon-to-be-sheriff Pat Garrett warns Billy that Murphy's men will make an attempt on Alex's life the following day. At Alex's house in Lincoln, the gang is surrounded by Murphy's men and famed outlaw John Kinney. Realizing that they were lured into a trap, the Regulators survive an entire day's shootout. U.S. Army troops on the Houses take arrive, as does Murphy himself with Yen, who runs inside and is reunited with Doc. Murphy orders the soldiers to set fire to the house, while Alex's wife leaves unharmed and Chavez slips away. Trapped in the burning attic, the gang throws Alex's possessions out of the window, including a trunk with Billy inside, allowing him to surprise their attackers. In the chaos, Chavez returns with their rescued horses, and Charlie and Kinney shoot each other dead. Doc and Yen ride away, and Steve gets a wounded Chavez onto the remaining horse to ride away at the cost of being gunned down himself. Alex is gunned down by a Gatling gun, and Billy escapes after shooting Murphy between the eyes. An epilogue from Doc reveals that Chavez took work at a farm in California, Doc moved east and married Yen Sun, Alex's widow became one of the most prominent cattlewomen of all time, and Murphy's ring of corruption collapsed. Billy continued to ride until he was killed by Garrett and buried next to Charlie at Fort Sumner, where someone later carved the epitaph: ""PALS""."
American Outlaws,"Confederate guerillas attempt to raid a Union Army camp late in the American Civil War. The guerillas are ambushed, but thanks to the sharp-shooting of Frank James and the distractions of his brother Jesse they survive. The James, along with their buddies, the Younger brothers, congratulate themselves but learn that the Confederacy has surrendered and the war is now over. The group decides to return to Missouri to their families and farms. When they arrive, their town is occupied by the Union Army. Jesse childhood friend and cousin Zee has grown into an attractive young woman, and there is a man hanging in the town square. Farmers are being pressured to sell their farms to the railroad company, who are expanding across the United States. If they don't sell their land to Thaddeus Rains, and his secret-service organizer, Allan Pinkerton, the farmers are burned out of their homes, or killed. Frank finds the railroad doesn't even need their land. The James and the Younger brothers don't want to sell, and Cole Younger loses his temper when several railroad men approach him about selling and kills two of them. The army authorities decide to hang him, but his brothers Bob and Jim, along with Jesse, Frank, and Zee, decide to rescue him. During the rescue, Jesse is shot in the shoulder, and hides out at Zee's. A few weeks later, when Jesse has recovered, the railroad sets fire to the James' home, killing Jesse's mother. The James and Younger brothers ride out for revenge against the railroad men but instead focus on the bank's payroll, reasoning that if they steal the money and attack supply trains, the army will notice. Dubbing themselves the James–Younger Gang, they set out robbing banks, with Pinkerton and Rains struggling to stop them. The James gang turns themselves into folk heroes in the process. The gang struggles over leadership, with Cole feeling that Jesse is getting an overblown ego from the publicity of the gang's activities. Jesse backs down, after an argument, and lets Cole plan and execute a robbery; Cole's chosen target proves to be a trap set by Pinkerton and Rains. Jim is shot and killed, and Jesse and his brother leave the gang, with Jesse later marrying Zee. The gang does not do well without the James brothers. People do not respect the Younger brothers as much as they did the James-Younger Gang. When Jesse and Zee attempt to start a new life, Pinkerton finds and arrests Jesse. During the train ride to the jail, Jesse is chained in a rear car, but tricks a deputy into showing his gun, which he takes from him and uses to escape to the top of the train car. Zee and the remainder of the Gang shoot a cannon at the train, stopping it and rescuing Jesse. Confronted with Rains and Pinkerton, Jesse shoots neither of them but rather Rains' prized watch. Pinkerton tells Jesse that he should go to Tennessee, as 'the railroad has no interest in Tennessee'."
The Revenant,"In late 1823, fur trapper Hugh Glass guides Captain Andrew Henry's trappers through the territory of the present-day Dakotas. While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by an Arikara war party which is seeking to recover its Chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. Many of the trappers are killed during the fight, and the rest of them escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel to Fort Kiowa on foot because Glass believes that traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore. While he is scouting game, Glass is mauled and left near death by a female grizzly bear which is guarding its cubs. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearing another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but he is unable to pull the trigger. Instead, he offers money in order to pay someone to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, in order to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts. After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is stopped by Hawk, who intervenes. Hawk threatens to shoot Fitzgerald and shouts for Bridger, who is away gathering water so Fitzgerald stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. At first, Bridger protests, but he ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. Bridger leaves his canteen, in which he engraved a spiral symbol, with Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits that he lied about the approaching Arikara. When Fitzgerald and Bridger later meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, but he knows nothing about Hawk's murder. Glass begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs a crude cauterization of his wounds and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into river rapids. He later encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that ""revenge is in the Creator's hands."" The men share bison meat and travel. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover that his wounds are healing, but French hunters have lynched Hikuc. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. Glass frees her, and while she castrates her rapist, he kills several hunters, and recovers Hikuc's horse. The following day, Glass is ambushed and driven over a cliff on his horse by the Arikara. He survives the stormy night by eviscerating the dead horse and sheltering inside its carcass. A frightened French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes his spiral engraved canteen as Glass's. Believing that it might be a surviving Hawk, Henry organizes a search party. Realizing that Glass is alive, Fitzgerald empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger, but Glass vouches for Bridger by stating that he was not present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk and he was later deceived and threatened by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald. After the two men split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills, and scalps Henry. Glass finds Henry's corpse, places it on his horse in an attempt to act as a decoy, and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank, where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Their chief Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald, and the Arikara (who have found Powaqa) spare Glass. Glass retreats into the mountains, where he is visited by his wife's spirit."
Roughshod,"Three escaped convicts led by Lednov kill three cowboys in Nevada and steal their clothes. They ride on looking for revenge against a rancher, Clay Phillips, who is warned by friend Jed Graham to get out of town. Clay and younger brother Steve head toward Sonora, California with a herd of horses. They come across four stranded saloon girls, Mary, Marcia, Elaine and Helen, with a broken wagon wheel. Marcia's fiance turns up to take her home. Elaine, who is depressed and ill, flees. Steve saves her and they end up at the Wyatt ranch, where it turns out Elaine is a long-missing daughter.  Back on the trail, Helen decides to stay with an Irishman named Fowler who has struck gold. An argument later leads Mary to steal Clay's wagon, which act is quickly discovered by Clay and Steve. During the short chase, the wagon becomes detached from the horses and plummets into the adjacent creek. Clay dashes into the water and retrieves a semi-conscious and soaking wet Mary, who quickly comes to. Clay's concern for her well-being suddenly returns to anger as Mary, seeing the rest of her clothing floating away downstream, is concerned about that instead of Clay's wagon that she just destroyed. This only solidifies Clay's resolve that she not continue with him and Steve onto Sonora and so puts her on a passing stagecoach to the next town. In the meanwhile, Lednov, in pursuit, comes upon the camp of Helen and Fowler and so roughs up Helen and kills Fowler to make her reveal where the Phillips brothers have gone. Upon finding them, a gunfight ensues, in which Clay and Steve are victorious, though Steve is wounded. Needing medical attention, Clay takes him to the town doctor where Mary appears and returns to Clay's arms."
The Searchers,"In 1868, Ethan Edwards returns after an eight-year absence to the home of his brother Aaron in the wilderness of West Texas. Ethan fought in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy, and in the three years since that war ended, he apparently fought in the Mexican revolutionary war, as well. He has a large quantity of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession, and a medal from the Mexican campaign that he gives to his eight-year-old niece, Debbie. As a former Confederate soldier, he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the Texas Rangers; he refuses. As Rev. Captain Samuel Clayton remarks, Ethan ""fits a lot of descriptions"". Shortly after Ethan's arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and when Captain Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them, they discover that the theft was a Comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families. When they return, they find the Edwards homestead in flames. Aaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, and Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted. After a brief funeral, the men set out in pursuit. They come upon a burial ground of Comanches who were killed during the raid. Ethan mutilates one of the bodies. When they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. The camp is deserted, and further along the trail, the men ride into an ambush. Although they fend off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Indians effectively. They return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy's fiancé, Brad Jorgensen and Debbie's adopted brother, Martin Pawley. Ethan finds Lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the Comanche camp. In a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the Indian camp and is killed. When winter arrives, Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch. Martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens' daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie. Ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie provides Martin with a horse to catch up. At Futterman's trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. In reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife, and the two men find a portion of Scar's band killed by soldiers. The search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to New Mexico, where a Mexican man leads them to Scar. They find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar's wives. She tells the men that she has become a Comanche, and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as an Indian, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape. Although Martin tends to Ethan's wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead. ""That'll be the day,"" Ethan replies, as they return home. Meanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin's absence. Ethan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie's wedding is about to begin. After a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous ""Yankee"" soldier, Lt. Greenhill, arrives with news that Ethan's half-crazy friend Mose Harper has located Scar. Clayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him. Martin kills Scar during the battle, and Ethan scalps him. Ethan then locates Debbie, and pursues her on horseback. Martin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised, but instead he sweeps her up onto his saddle. ""Let’s go home,"" he says. Debbie is brought to the Jorgensen ranch, and Martin reunites with Laurie. In an iconic closing scene, Ethan departs the homestead as he arrived—alone—clutching his arm, the cabin door slowly shutting on his receding image."
